    <p>The Scoop is $25/year, and it offers all the cookies you can have. Mounds and mounds of them, baked by energetic graduates (or current students) trying to make a living—working on their novels or paintings or whatnot in the daytime, baking cookies in a semi-somnolent state in the evenings. They seem especially prone to laughter.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>It’s been my favorite haunt for fifty years. Of course, as a freshman they took us to every tea shop to get a sample, until we were so full with caffeine that we wouldn’t dream of sleeping until the next night, and so full of liquid that there were lines for the bathrooms everywhere we went. Groups of freshmen sang in merriment as they caroused down the sidewalk, sweeping paper cups of tea samples off the platters held by smartly dressed waiters. I remember those days fondly.</p>
<p>Trevisia, with her thick braids that look like bread twists that are colored red, green, and yellow, is at the counter today, ready to assist anyone who is struggling with the hot water machine (and ready to administer first aid if they accidentally pour boiling water on themselves), coming up with creative names for each batch of cookies (such as “Flourclouds” or “Fantasmittles”), and making sure that no one takes more than their fair share of cookies. (What constitutes a “fair share” is subject to debate. Certainly, anyone who takes five cookies and leaves will be subject to “cold tea” in the future.)<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>The Scoop Bakers are the people who know the most students by name.<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> After all, almost every student comes by the Scoop (except those who have gluten allergies, people on low-sugar diets (including Stoics), and those in the Poly House, who prefer to bake their own cookies), and it is difficult not to get drawn into the Scoop Bakers’ monologues-turned-dialogues (are we ourselves cookies being baked by the oven that is Philosophocle? when will we be ready? will there will be little time to bask in our fullness before we are eaten? what do you think, oh cookie-taker?). Plus, if you know the Bakers well enough, they may even surprise you with a birthday cookie on your birthday and sing to you. (Wisely, they do not do the same to me; I do not like to be reminded of my birthdays. Furthermore, the calendar is an <a href="leap-day.html">artificial construct</a>.)</p>
<p>Do note that coming to the Scoop means consenting to be people-watched by the Bakers, who look over the counter at the amassed tables of students (and lonely professors like me who need a little evening brightness, or sugar, in their lives) like benign life-giving gods and goddesses.<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The students munch cookies while conversing in the hushed tones of confidants; or screaming out their new “slam poems”; or screwing up their brows in concentration as they practice their deconstruction skills on towers made of wooden blocks; or drawing on the wall-to-wall blackboards with colored chalk in either hand, trying their best to be ambidextrous artists. Or they stare at space (or perhaps Trevisia’s rainbow braids) as they wait for inspiration, a pen poised frozen in their hands, a cookie cooling in front of them, to be resisted until they have written the next sentence in their thesis.</p>
<p>Everything here has a unique character. Take the chairs for example. There is the throne sofa (first-come, first-serve) and its foil, the “baby stool” that short people like to make their tall friends sit on, the one four-legged chairs that wobbles, the foldable chair that will fold when you try to sit on it, a chair made of cardboard (donated by an engineering student who has graduated).<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The hot water machine also has character: sometimes the water fails to stop when you turn off the spigot.</p>
<section class="footnotes">
<hr />
<ol>
<li id="fn1"><p>Lisa worked as a baker for the Scoop for one day before she was fired. She cursed out a student for taking two cookies when there was one more person in line. The Bakers prefer to take a <em>passive</em>-agressive stance towards cookie gluttons, because other patrons are unforgiving enough towards anyone who makes them wait thirty minutes for the next batch of cookies.<a href="#fnref1">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>Except for Trevisia. A student of mine reported meeting Trevisia five times under different names, before she caught on. The sixth time, she remembered his name as being a combination of the five names he had given her. Memory works in odd ways.<a href="#fnref2">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>More than once, conversations in The Scoop have made their ways into novels by former Scoop-bakers-turned-writers. Chances are increased if you are a regular patron—all the more reason to come frequently.<a href="#fnref3">↩</a></p></li>

<p>Subject: <a href="/posts/these-bachelor-monks.html">Lisa</a></p>
<p>Topic: Lisa’s conversation with Fron</p>
<p>Venue: <a href="/posts/the-street.html">The Electric Eel</a></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>LISA: Standard introduction: Fron attempts to summarize himself. His favorite theorem is the Law of Large Numbers. It resonates with his philosophy, which is that over a period of many years, a moral person will with high probability, be happier, than an immoral person, and it is also very useful in Data Science. His spirit animal is a sea turtle. He used to be an overachiever—for example, writing six pages for a five-page book report—until he joined the Uniformists. He despises frivolousness, such as the <a href="/posts/snowmelt.html">“ornaments” that were placed on the Uniformed Snowmen</a>. <!--more--></p>
<p>I drop my spoon into my Dragon’s Breath Noodle Soup, sit up, and make my mind to curse him out—of course you’ve guessed that I did much of the decorating—but he continues on obliviously.</p>
<p>“But most importantly, my favorite episode during the unnamed radio hour is the one on the luminescent sea creatures, such as jellyfish.” He sees me staring at him, and asks, “Do you know about it?”</p>
<p>It happened that I’d listened to that very episode. At that moment I have a very good idea.</p>
<p>“<em>Know</em> about it?” I say, “I was the <em>host</em>. I didn’t know anyone even <em>listened</em> at that hour.”</p>
<p>“You,” he exclaims, “You’re the jellyfish girl.”</p>
<p>“I feel it presumptive to nickname me based on the contents of my radio show,” I berate him.</p>
<p>He duly apologizes.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>ME: It wasn’t you.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>LISA: Of course not! If I’d been passionate about oceanology, I would have told you long ago. It was Pearl. But he didn’t know, of course.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>ME: Then what does he say?</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>LISA: He puts down his corn-on-the-cob. He puts his hands around his kale-strawberry smoothie, looks at me very seriously (like a professor, or perhaps a stray dog) and says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Lisa, I believe we have a serious connection. I cannot overstate the symbolic significance of that episode in my life. On its surface it seems no more than a slice of esoterica, no different from the thousands of pieces of knowledge that we absorb every day, but at its core, it is the essence of beauty. Many have strayed from the path of truth because they seek it not for its radiant light, but for their own dark, ulterior motives. From your voice, however, I instantly knew that you were not one of them. You were speaking of a subject that you found beautiful in itself. I could imagine that your eyes were looking not in front of you, but instead at the luminescent jellyfish inside your own head. That to me is the essence of Philosophocle.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He waits for an answer.</p>
<p>“But I <em>had</em> an ulterior motive,” I tell him. “They wouldn’t allow me to broadcast the radio program I wanted to unless I ‘practiced’ in the unnamed radio hour first. They didn’t even allow me to say what I wanted, they put this random book in my hand and told me to recite it in the most sibilant voice I could manage. And afterwards they told me that sorry, their lineup was full, and that they would give me 10 dollars in dining credit to make up for their reneged promise! I have regretted that foray into radio ever since.”</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>ME: (laughs, clinking ice cubes in my “iced tea.”)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>LISA: He’s dumbfounded. He accuses me of lying, claims I wasn’t the girl on the radio. So I give him a rendition. Just a few sentences. It’s not even accurate, but he falls for it. Then he tries to convince me that I’d do well to adopt the character that I represented in that hour of my life.</p>
<p>I tell him that his obsession is illogical, borders on sexual fantasy, and is making me uncomfortable.</p>
<p>He looks into his soup and tells me,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“One person’s running water is another’s poetry.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He’s so earnest about it that it almost makes me feel bad. But as I’m considering telling him the truth, he abruptly stands up.</p>
<p>“Usually I don’t leave in the middle of a meal unfinished,” he says, “But this time I must. I hope thereafter, you will remember your radio hour with the same degree of dissatisfaction of termination as that which I am feeling now, in cutting my perfectly good meal short. If you ever change your mind, let me know. It’ll put my heart at rest.”</p>
<p>Then he throws his half-eaten corn-on-the-cob and pours his half-drunk rest kale-strawberry smoothie in the compost bin! He swings by the table again, and leaves. What do you make of that?</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>ME: Don’t worry, Lisa, you did the Right Thing. That was perfectly executed. This school is a zoo of mental deficiencies. Students lacking recreational activities—hell, there isn’t even <a href="these-bachelor-monks-ii.html">proper <em>coffee</em></a>—tend to fixate on random events in their life as if they were magic portals that would rescue them from the meaninglessness that they deny experiencing, and the more bluntly we can make them realize this by shattering their objects of obsession, the better.</p>
<p><em>Hell!</em> I can’t stop talking like them, ugh!</p>
<p>(I slide an ice cube in my mouth to wash away that long sentence, and down the remaining iced tea.)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>(At this point, we are both surprised as a man in a dark suit comes up to our table. He takes off his hat. His forehead is bright with sweat. His eyes sparkle like miniature disco balls. Behind him on the dance stage, customers fumble, unsure about their moves now that their instructor is gone. Because he is none other than…)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>THE GREAT DANZINI: Ladies, I can’t help but overhear. I wonder whether you can diagnose my own deficiencies.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>LISA: (Amused) And what may those be?</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>THE GREAT DANZINI: There appears to be a lack of women in my life.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>LISA: Another actor, eh? Well, buy me some more iced tea and then we’re talking.</p>

    <p><a href="/posts/these-bachelor-monks.html">&lt; Part I</a></p>
<p>There’s no lack of coffeehouses on the Street (although they call themselves teahouses, and the coffee menu is always second. Sure, to have one person prefer tea over coffee was reasonable, but a whole society? The professors and students, I concluded, must not like being jolted out of their book-induced stupor, because then they might be encouraged to try other things as well). <!--more--> It doesn’t seem, however, that these people have much of a notion of privacy - hardly I’d sit down and someone would slide in the seat across from me, introduce themselves (and their thesis topic!), and ask about me or about “the weather.” The teahouses branded themselves on being places to meet interesting strangers, and boy, was I an interesting stranger (no wonder they double-stamp my loyalty cards! I probably increased their business). I answered their questions with extensive responses that would make even the loquacious among them flinch. (The weather is shitting today. One cannot go outside without millions of liquid globules worming their way into one’s clothes. It brings to mind the inelegance of existence: are we not all bags of meat and excrement? Could the clouds not ‘use the toilet’ somewhere else, to use a euphemic term? But one aspect of cloud-shitting and human-shitting is quite different, in the degree of passion in which the heavens shit down upon us: might this be to suggest a degree of passion which is missing among the inhabitants of this world?)</p>
<p>There’s quite a few students who keep wanting to “talk to me,” “be my friend,” and so forth. I know what they want, but they won’t say it out loud, and I’m not sure that they could even say it to themselves if their lives depended on it! I, of course, will never initiate action, because that would quite ruin my follow-up, “observational” study on the sexual suppression of Philosophocle students. Instead they say that they’ve learned a new outlook on their search for knowledge by the unrivaled, symbolic contrariness of my actions, a fundamentally different and unique way of being… and then they pause as if expecting me to say something more than just “Good for you!” To use a vulgarity from the outside world, most of them never get to “first base.” (If they had sports teams, maybe they would release some of their pent-up energy…)</p>
<p>I much rather prefer Deepsea Teas. One can get a table alone there, and even draw up the curtains. I like the booths by the fish tanks. The fish stare at me and look as if they’re mouthing silent speeches at me (“Do most of our words not fall deaf on the ears of the world?” was a favorite question of Dr. “Fishface” Adams; if you attempted to reply to his question, your answer would indeed fall deaf on the ears of Dr. “Fishface” Adams). Their coffee is expensive, but if you buy their mug you get unlimited refills each visit. I heartily approve.</p>

  <div class="blog-main">
    <p>Before the snowmelt, we gathered the snowmen and snowwomen onto trolleys that snaked through the gently sloping paths of Philosophocle. <!--more--> We started from the highest point - the observatory and meteorological station (where the blackboard recorded gradually rising temperatures over the next week) - and then onwards past the library, the Pinnacle of Philosophy, the mathematics building, and the rest of the departments, detouring to drive through Philosophocle’s many gardens. The gym, dining halls, and residential halls came last.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>The snowpeople builders waited patiently. They had no desire to be like John from last year, who, eschewing trolleys, had tripped when he tried to carry his snowwoman himself. His snowwoman immediately had broken into three and each part had rolled down the hill separately.</p>
<p>When the trolley came, the snowpeople builders hoisted their buildees onto the chilled planks. Sometimes the snowpeople’s bottoms were stuck to the snow, and had to be gingerly shoveled out. Ten people assisted with pulling and pushing each trolley. Perhaps this was more than necessary, but it made sure that the trolley did not accelerate too fast.</p>
<p>Many a snowperson had been abandoned by its builder. We moved them ourselves. Some of them had already sickened, their formerly round heads and bodies turned concave. Rhina patted new snow onto them and reaffixed their appendages in the right locations. Tom, who had a supply of branches, pine cones, acorns, raisins, carrots, celery, plum tomatoes, chocolates, and spring onions handy, provided snowpeople with missing body parts.</p>
<p>It is quite rude of the creators to not furnish their createes with mouths or arms. It is also rude of the creators to not furnish their createes with names. Fortunately, Trevisia, a Creativist, can spontaneously generate names that have never been used, like Windorrilyna and Asnozzonoso. She is not very good at remembering them, but fortunately we have Albern, who jotted them down diligently onto the roster.</p>
<p>Trevisia was horrified by the row of Uniformed Snowmen in front of Campus Police. The Uniformists made them, of course. Thirty Uniformists, in their identical U sweaters, in groups of three, made ten snowmen. They constructed the snowmen to specifications: bottom ball 40 centimeters, middle ball 35 centimeters, top ball 30 centimeters. They all wore identical berets and saluted with branches bent at identical angles. Their belts contained holsters, each with three standard-issue 8-centimeter snowballs. The ten snowmen would occupy a trolley by themselves; they won’t associate with the rabble. Each snowman was carried by three Uniformists. They aren’t necessarily the same Uniformists who made them, because of course, Uniformists are interchangeable, as are Uniformed Snowmen.</p>
<p>“Names?” Trevisia asked.</p>
<p>“The Uniformed,” said Un, the leader of the Uniformists.</p>
<p>“I mean, their <em>individual names</em>,” Trevisia said, dangerously.</p>
<p>“Where one goes, all go,” Un said, as his Uniformists took up their places around the trolley. “No individuality is required.”</p>
<p>“Snowpeople without names are not allowed in the Shades.”</p>
<p>“Trevisia!” I hissed. “Drop it!”</p>
<p>The Uniformists looked restless. With so many vulnerable snowmen around, we did not want to risk a fight.</p>
<p>Trevisia took off her rainbow scarf and rushed towards the Uniformed trolley. Un moved to stop her but she threw and the scarf landed around one of the uniformed snowman, distinguishing him from the other nine. It was a grave insult. One of the Unis yanked it off. The other Unis reached for their snowmen’s ammunition. They aimed at Trevisia. In panic, Trevisia jumped onto our trolley, and it started moving forward. The Unis fired. Several hit Trevisia on her back, while several others missed and hit a snowman on our cart, toppling its head.</p>
<p>“Stop!” Un yelled. “This is not the Uniformist way!” Tom and Albern from our group picked up snow to retaliate.</p>
<p>“The cart!” I yelled.</p>
<p>It was veering away from the path, downhill. We ran to catch it. It took all of us to stop the cart. Another head toppled from the sudden deceleration.</p>
<p>Trevisia was in tears. She didn’t speak, just violently brushed snow off her coat. One of the Uniformists dangled her scarf in front of her.</p>
<p>“We are sorry, madam. It won’t happen again.”</p>
<p>Trevisia snatched her scarf back and dries her eyes with it. The twenty-nine other Unis come too.</p>
<p>“How may we assist in rebuilding your snowmen?”</p>
<p>“They’re not snow<em>men</em>! They’re snowmen-and-<em>women</em>! Like this one you killed!” She pointed at a head grinning at the sky. “Don’t put your dirty hands on our snowpeople!”</p>
<p>The Uniformists looked at Un, unsure.</p>
<p>“Let’s go, Unis.”</p>
<p>They took up positions at their cart and wheeled it away.</p>
<hr>
<p>Rhina and Tom repaired our snowpeople, and we made it the rest of the way to the Shades without incident. Last year, we had been ambushed in front of Peterhall by students throwing snowballs from the roof. One of them had hit the snow-giraffe, whose neck had taken Rhina a whole hour to make. We identified the culprit, and demanded that he explain himself.</p>
<p>“Impermanence,” he had said. “We wanted to show that the effort of preserving snowpeople is futile. Snowpeople melt, whether they are alone or together.”<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> We forced him to sit outside for an entire day in the Shades watching the snowmen melt, in order to appreciate impermanence. The penance had a profound effect on him, and he became very quiet after that, with a furtive look as if haunted by ghosts, the same kind of look people got a few months after joining the Poly House.</p>
<p>When we arrived at the Shades, the Uniformed Snowmen had already taken their positions in a semicircle in front of the courtyard. We set up the rest of the snowpeople inside the courtyard. As more snowpeople came in, we arranged them in groups facing each other, like conversational groups at <a href="the-street.html">Melli’s Flows</a>. We gave them bottles of Iced Tea that Lisa had collected from the Electric Eel (she’s somewhat of an addict). The only ones who didn’t join in the merry party atmosphere were the Uniformed, looking out at the sun.</p>
<p>Why do we do this? Ten years ago, the students had found their snowpeople disappearing from where they were built. They appeared at the Shades: a courtyard that always in shadow from the slanted winter sun. For four years this migration was continued by a mysterious altruist who was never discovered. After that, the student graduated (presumably), but the rest of the student body has carried on the tradition. Each year before the weather warms, we carry the snowmen to the Shades, where they melt together, rather than alone. During this period, at any time during the day, it is likely that at least one student will be watching the snowpeople’s silent soiree. It seems to be a metaphor to life: even if we put on a veneer of merrymaking like the snowpeople do, we are all slowly melting. Or the converse: since we are all slowly melting, we might as well merrymake together.</p>
<hr>
<p>Early the next morning, strolling past the Shades, I found that the Uniformed Snowmen had all been distinguished! One had a pine-cone badge, another had a garland of leaves, another had acorn buttons, and yet another had dried cranberry nipples! Anxiety gripped my throat: I had to remove them before the Uniformed saw them - surely they would take revenge on Trevisia for defacing their watchmen! I hurried over after looking furtively around to see that no one else was there, and then started to remove the ornaments. Perhaps if one of the Uniformed arrived, they would mistakenly think I was the culprit, but it was be a chance that I had to take.</p>
<p>“In the name of Santa-fucking-Claus, stop!” someone shouted. I turned around to see Lisa running up. “This is shit-tastic, what the dammit are you doing! Oh bitches, I think I screwed up word usage again,” she made a face. “Why are you thieving the watchmen?”</p>
<p>I explained what had happened.</p>
<p>“Don’t you worry, homey-boy, the Uniformists will have to go through me before they get to Trev! Now be a good elf and put those back, won’t you?”</p>
<p>I was relieved to be relieved of my vigilantist responsibility. Lisa walked around the Uniformed Snowmen furrowing her brows critically as if they were sculptures at an art museum, while I skittered off.</p>
<p>I didn’t come by the Shades until the evening. Remarkably enough, the baubles stayed where they were, although the nippled snowman gained a few more… indecencies. Lisa had worked her magic. Still, over the next week, I noticed that Trevisia darted past the Shades without looking at the snowmen, as if afraid of being caught looking.</p>
<hr>
<p>Already the snowpeople have crooked smiles and missing eyes. The squirrels and birds feast on them.<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>But perhaps the Uniformists will have the last laugh. Despite all our fancy decorations, the snowmen will soon start to become indistinguishable in their misery (we are all alike in death). The Uniformed will be first to go, their position being most vulnerable to the sun. The rest will soon follow.</p>

    <p>These bachelor monks think that by having their minds inured to the pleasures of higher knowledge, they’ve vanquished all their earthly desires. Well, every day students sneak glances in my direction. <!--more--> Sometimes I smile back, sometimes I wink, sometimes I turn my head away just as they look, sometimes I toss my hair, sometimes I bow my head and fiddle with the straps of my dress, sometimes I scowl. They hearten or dishearten accordingly. It’d make scientists proud, the way I experiment. At this point I can even usually tell if someone will look my way a second before they actually do. At first I thought this was the “confirmation bias” they were teaching us about - you know, how people think they’re superman and and telepathic and psychokinesthetic because they only notice the 1% of the time that they actually succeed - so I actually tallied and well, I actually predict correctly more than half the time. I think I could make a thesis out of this, except I have no desire to analyze the flying cows out of such a gem that life throws at me. (It is tempting, though. It would certainly inject some much-needed liveliness into those academic journals. I can imagine little acolytes taking the heavy “Social Psychology” journal from its shelf, going into a private study cubby, to check out what this oft-cited paper was all about, and then missing their dinnertimes because they’re hanging on every word. The equivalent of a romantic thriller. They’ll put the journal back on the shelf, unaware that a few minutes later another student will take it off. They’ll remember the name of the author, too, and look her up in the computer cluster at night, when no one else is around - strictly for follow-up research, of course. And maybe I could hang around on campus after I graduate, and secretly observe this process! These philosopher types are suckers for meta-analysis.) The students here, though, turn far less interesting material into theses.</p>
<p>Yes, I’m quite well-known because I strolled into Intro to Debate freshman year with a pink shirt that exposed my hip, and a purple miniskirt. I quite stood out from the other students in their drab greens and browns. (“Anyone can distinguish themselves by their clothing. It takes a true scholar to distinguish emself by their work.”) The professor, Dr. Flindus, called me up to the front of the class and asked me to “defend myself” as he listed off my flagrant abuses of the dress code. (Dr. Flindus, though, is not so far gone as some of the professors - he looked steadily at me as he recited - quite a good excuse to get some eye candy.) After his eloquent condemnation - I was drinking in every word; after all, you do have to learn people’s language in order seduce them - he adjusted his glasses and stared at me, waiting for my response.</p>
<p>“Would you agree that free speech includes the right to remain silent?” I asked. He thought very hard about it (looking at my exposed belly all the time) before he said yes.</p>
<p>“Then you must agree, too, that freedom of clothing includes the right to remain naked?” With that I started undoing the buttons to my blouse. Dr. Flindus reddened; this was obviously outside his rhetorical repertoire. Smartly, I decided to take it no further than this. “On second thought, I refuse to disrobe in front of those who obviously cannot appreciate the human body,” I said as I took my seat.</p>
<p>At the end of the class, I’d found several notes dropped into my open bookbag, from students who wrote that they, indeed, appreciated the human body.</p>

    <p>Fron has informed me that that today is a special day in the outside world called “leap day.” <!--more--> In every country besides ours, February has 28 days, except when it has 29 days, which happens every 4th year except every 100th year except every 400th year.</p>
<p>“<em>29 days?</em>” Un asks, surprised and indignant, when I pass on the information to him. “Even when February earns an extra day, she still has fewer days than any other month?”</p>
<p>Un finds such a custom symptomatic of the capitalistic and despotic tendencies of the outside world. A philosophy of inequality permeates their society so deeply that it manifests itself in their basic conception of time.</p>
<p>“Like February, the poor stay poor,” Un says, “Once in a while they are given money or opportunity. And then? ‘Just kidding!’ as the Americans would say. Back to another 3 years of being <em>even shorter</em> than everyone else!”</p>
<p>I of course challenge Un to demonstrate a link between foreign calendars and capitalism. After some well-spent hours on hemerological research, Un explains to me that the rulers of old, such as Augustus Caesar, had the habit of naming months after themselves, and stealing days from other months until their own namesake had 31 days. (They are quite foolish to believe that mortal humans can alter the flow of time in any way, for calendars are only artificial constructs. Time is a continuum, infinitely divisible and infinitely long, as beautiful, God-given, and untouchable by humans as the real numbers.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>) February, formerly the last month of the year, was the natural target of temporal theft.</p>
<p>But, foreign reader, you must be wondering about our own calendary practices! In our calendary, all months have either 30 or 31 days, as is reasonable. This year, February has 30 days, as does its brother March. The intercalary (leap) day is shared among months as in a cooperative society; this year, May has the good fortune of having 31 days.</p>
<p>Visitors often gripe about our system, staring dumbfoundedly at the discrepancy between the complimentary “Seasons of Philosophocle” calendars we offer them and their cell-phone clocks. Their frowns betray their thoughts: How dare a backwards society like ours inconvenience them with a date change! I beg to differ. It is us who are leading the way in egalitarianism, and the rest of the world refuses to follow.</p>
<p>Some of our banks have caved to the pressure of the outside world. It seems that the date discrepancy has caused many glitches, including the loss of thousands of dollars, and investors going berserk on the phone while the bank tellers try unsuccessfully to give them a practical course in anger management. Here at Philosophocle, however, we are thankfully under no such financial pressure, and are free to pursue the higher fruits of intellectual endeavors.</p>

    <p>Dave, the techie, has created glasses that filter out non-red light. Thus, looking at the snowfields outside, we see fields of red that make us want to vomit. <!--more--> This reminds us that although snow insinuates itself as a symbol of purity and innocence, it is the cause of widespread death: many a family has met tragedy when their breadwinner dies in a snow-related traffic accident on eir way to work.</p>
<p>These “blood-glasses” help us keep our focus, especially when we are feeling discouraged in our academic work: not only will we resist the hypnotic tendency to stare at the mounds of freshly-fallen snow and let our minds go blank, we will turn up our lips in disgust at the masochistic students building bloodmen (who will bleed to death slowly when the sun shines) outside, and aggressively close the window shades to avoid nausea, instead seeking refuge in our books.</p>
<p>When I suggested to Dave that his invention would have been much more useful back in December, he told me that he, too, had been willfully blind to the dangers of snow until his father’s death. Despite the fact that the snow will soon melt, however, all his glasses have sold out, as many students reasoned that they would be cheaper now than at the beginning of next winter, just as The Shop of Forgotten Things marks up the prices of its umbrellas by 10% during rainy days. Dave reports that some of these students have found a secondary use of the glasses for the non-winter months ahead of us.</p>
<p>“Blue light at night is harmful to our circadian rhythms,” Klarissa says, citing a research article on human biology, “so we use the glasses to study late while minimizing the effects on our sleep.”</p>
<p>Dave apologizes for the shortage, and promises that before next winter, he will have manufactured many more such glasses.</p>

  <div class="blog-main">
    <p>After my student, Fron, ran to my office excitedly yesterday evening, saying the weblog was up, I eagerly followed him to the computer lab. <!--more--> Many of our students were gathered around the screen. They watched me connect to the “Internet”, open the “browser”, and type in the “address” of our weblog.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>I was dismayed. Where was the introduction that I had mailed to our webmaster two weeks ago? Only after I had mailed the introduction did Fron inform me that it would be faster to send it over the Internet. This is what I did for the <a href="the-street.html">second post</a>. I typed it up and gave it to Fron, who told me with a frustrated look on his face that I was not supposed to type it with a typewriter, but a computer, or it would not get turned into bits to be sent over the Internet!</p>
<p>I had closed my eyes and told Fron, “Breathe. Is it right for you to be frustrated at your professor? Given how many times professors have patiently explained things to you while possibly harboring unspoken thoughts about your lack of intelligence, could you not return the favor?”</p>
<p>Fortunately, Fron is not <a href="these-bachelor-monks.html">Lisa</a>, and was immediately chastised. He then proceeded to re-type the post and e-mail it. I believe Fron is a good student, even though he often gets caught in the spur of the moment. There is a reason that students in his year are called “sophomores.”</p>
<p>After some discussion, we realized why my second post was up but not the first. I had communicated to the webmaster that my post was not to be published until he had received the other post as well. Fron, however, being more versed in electronic mail, had e-mailed a post of his own, before my handwritten post had arrived, triggering the webmaster’s criterion to publish prematurely. Together we decided to email the webmaster to clear up the confusion, and apologize for the lack of an introductory post.</p>
<p>Our next topic of discussion was Fron’s post. “Of all the topics you could have weblogged about, why did you choose <a href="PHSS.html">PHSS</a>? And of all the wonderful shows we have on PHSS, why did you choose the unnamed radio hour? I find this narrowly focused article unrepresentative of our institution.”</p>
<p>“But professor, Dr. Drim told us in Creative Writing class that it is always better to be specific than general, and that we should write about what moves us emotionally, rather than what we feel like is ‘representative’. There is no one article that can be representative of Philosophocle, because Philosophocle is made of disparate parts. (Perhaps we should change our motto to ‘pinnacles of higher education’?) How can we have true cultural exchange if we only exchange the parts that are ‘representative’?”</p>
<p>I admitted that Fron had a point, and turned to the more pressing issue of the missing post. I suggested that the webmaster backdate the introductory post to be the first post. However, the webmaster informed me in the e-mail chat that he had not yet received the introductory post!</p>
<p>“Professor,” Fron said over my shoulder, “Backdating is something that the outside world does, usually for financial gain. We do not want to associate ourselves with that, do we?”</p>
<p>Once again I had to admit my student was right. It is uncertain when the introductory post will arrive. The webmaster has assured me he will put it up immediately after he receives it.</p>
<p>I feel like I am behind the times. After some bargaining, Fron has agreed to teach me the basics of computers<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>, in return for some tutoring in philosophy. I naturally agreed.</p>
<section class="footnotes">
<hr />
<ol>
<li id="fn1"><p>The use of such a familiar term around unfamiliar technology is comforting. I find the term “browser”, however, a misnomer, for it reminds me of the actions of zebras on the safari. Fron informed me that it is that other meaning of “browse” that is intended, namely, looking cursorily and non-seriously through documents. I object to this meaning because of its connotation: will foreign eyes look cursorily and non-seriously at the going-ons in our institution?<a href="#fnref1">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>I told him that I had read a book on Computability Theory. However, he informed me that this was not relevant to actual computers.<a href="#fnref2">↩</a></p></li>

    <p>Studying late at night, it can be tempting to turn on the radio to see what is playing on the school’s station, PHSS (pronounced, “fiss”). At 3 or 4 in the morning, the programs are often unconventional. <!--more--> One day it might be “Mocha moves dance music,” another day it might be one student’s sleepless soliloquy on the current state of the world, another day it might be “the sound of various things dropping, like pins, toilet paper rolls, and feathers,” on another, it might be a student reciting a book of “American Knock-knock jokes.” It is fascinating, during those early-morning nights when one feels that one is the only person alive in the world, to feel oneself on the periphery as one tunes in to the story of another’s life - or as much of it as can be inferred from the crackly soundwaves.</p>
<p>I discovered these programs when, one night, grabbing my alarm-clock-cum-radio from my bedside table to check my remaining time to sleep before my early flight, accidentally hit the “on” switch. I soon forgot all about sleep as I listened to a mellifluous voice talking about various luminescent creatures in the deep sea. Those soundwaves have echoed in my head as I traveled from Philosophocle, and became a symbol for nostalgia: for in my travels abroad, I have never heard a voice so content with esoterica as the mysterious stranger on that radio whom I have never been able to identify.</p>
<p>Since then I have been a follower of this unnamed radio hour, “programming” my radio to turn on for one hour and whisper into my pillow. Many times, some of the words warp into my dreams. Today, however, I was jolted awake by a voice unlike any I had heard previously, “You know what, no one is listening at this time of night anyway, so I can do whatever I want! I think I’m going to play this favorite tune of mine, it’s called armpit farting, by Yours Truly!” I need not describe the cacophony that followed; I had to shut off the radio and whisper “luminescent jellyfish” a few hundred times before I could fall asleep again.</p>
<p>When I woke up, I prepared to let the radio program be a forgotten nightmare. Imagine my horror when, arriving at Introduction to Data Science just in time as the teacher started lecture (using the methods of the course, over a period of 20 days I had found the exact second I should leave the dorm to arrive on time to class 95% of the time), I found that the entire front row of students had started to engage in that vulgar activity, and the rest of the class was erupting in laughs, some genuine and some uneasy! I had always thought myself one of few that listened to the unnamed radio hour, but now I realize my error in believing that something so interesting could escape the attention of students who fed on soul-enlightening moments. (It is the same error of romanticizing that one is the only person in existence late at night.) The whole incident had become “viral,” and a quite many people had obtained recordings of the 11:58 performance, much to my dismay in the rest of the classes. I wished I could be as nonchalant as the professors, who knew that to object was the fan the flames of student ridicule (“throwing nuts from heaven”), but could only, alas, whisper “luminescent jellyfish” to myself.</p>
<p>No one was happier about the incident than Yano, whose thesis had been “Virality as a natural phenomenon.” We had prided ourselves on the resistance of Philosophocle to the crass forms of virality that, in the outside, digitized world, was symptomatic of attention deficit disorder, temptation irresistance, and a general sense of modern meaninglessness, so Yano had little to write about until today, when he can be found dashing from classroom to dining area to common room with a recorder on hand, cataloguing the first viral outbreak as it occurred.</p>

    <p>In Philosophocle, the street is lined with cafes and snackeries. Each advertises a different atmosphere. The high-class Starset has individual tables, uniformed waiters with silver-star badges, mochas drawn in the shape of maidens, and hot chocolate in tall glasses with swirly chocolate straws. The crowd-pleasing Delites offers bubble tea, self-serve yogurt machines with toppings, and mochis in tantalizing rows beneath cartoon pictures of themselves, the color of their filling leaking through their faces like a soft blush. <!--more--> Simplitea provides a tea bag, hot water, and a place to sit for 50 cents. At Delites you go with a group of friends - no one will pay attention to you if you go alone - but at Serendipiteas, you are ushered in to a random seat, facing someone you do not know. In Melli’s Flows the conversations never stop, hurried on by the always-present bubbling fountain (careful: the fish bite), and guests are encouraged to journey from table to table, with different h’ors d’oveures at each table to tempt (free with entrance ticket).</p>
<p>There are tea houses to suit every taste - for the poor and the rich, for those who enjoy talking about the weather<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> to those who enjoy talking about ancient philosophy, world problems, or the most vulnerable yearning parts of one’s soul. (There is one for quick romances as well, Impassioatta.) I would suggest consulting the Unofficial Guide to Tea, released by the Students for Students Club at the University, but it is not updated as often as the teahouses change managers or compete to put up new menus, so it is easy to fall out of date. On the plus side, there has been a recent influx of art majors on the Committee, and they have decided to represent the major flavors of tea and coffee at the different teahouses with characters, which they give personalities - Green at The Leafy Bough is a gentleman in a suit, who will proffer you napkins before you ask for them, as opposed to Silk at Melli’s, a smooth-talking man in a rainbow shirt whose hands are always moving, as opposed to Matcha at Delites, a plump little girl who will tell you all about the newest episodes of the current anime that is sweeping those into Eastern culture.</p>
<p>Recently there has been a new addition. The Electric Eel, it is called, and it looks like it has been dropped here from another continent. It has an imported neon sign that flashes, its mascot eel alternating between blue and electric yellow. It is taking a lot of business away from the other teahouses. They dim their lights, turn on fog machines during the evenings, and serve iced tea rather than hot tea. If you ask me, they dilute the tea with too many ice cubes, but a lot of people seem to like clinking them around in their glasses. There is a dance floor, with strips of light flowing around the walls. There is some guy there who gives dance lessons, not the kind of ballroom dancing you do with a partner, but a dance you do individually. I hear that it is amazing, people lined up in rows trying to copy the Great Danzini as they creak their joints in 360 degrees of movement and the “disco ball” alternately spotlights different amateur dancers. No one knows whether there is one Danzini or three or ten, behind his mask - how can one man stay up dancing every night for so many hours? He never talks. He gets lots of tips.</p>
<p>I am not so sure about the Electric Eel. Some of us think it is a bad influence from the Continent, where such things are called “nightclubs” and are home to uncontrolled lewdness (Impassionatta, on the other hand, is quite controlled.). But we of course let the students have their fun, as long as they are not violent.</p>
