  <div class="blog-main">
    <p>Welcome to the What’s Happening in Philosophocle (WHiP) column. Recently, we have gotten several complaints that the blog is “full of <a href="http://holdenlee.github.io/philosophocle/posts/re-PHSS.html">gossip</a>,” “full of hot air,” and “all words and no pictures.” This column will remedy the situation: every time I will bring you an interview with a professor, who will tell us how their research is relevant in everyday life. Today I bring you an interview with Professor Rando, who has a dual appointment in the Math and Technology Departments. He is also a acclaimed storyteller, and the only Professor to have won the annual <a href="http://holdenlee.github.io/philosophocle/posts/the-scoop.html">Scoop</a> Story Slam.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>ME: Professor Rando, could you tell us about your research on randomness? As we all know, randomness is very useful in everyday life—a dice game would be pretty dull without it! And of course, the <a href="how-i-became-a-creativist-ii.html">Randomizer</a> is an integral part of the hazing, I mean initiation, process for Creativists.</p>
<p>PROF. RANDO: Ah, let me tell you a story about the first Randomizer that was ever used on Philosophocle Campus.</p>
<p>ME: You mean the Randomizer that Creator, the founder of the Creativists, created?</p>
<p>PROF. RANDO: No, Junali, the first Randomizer predates even the creation of the Creativists.</p>
<p>A long, long time ago in Philosophocle there was a student named Decitis who was incapable of making decisions. For example, when he went to Cold Hills Ice Cream Shoppe with his friends, he couldn’t decide which flavor to get. Every time, he would either end up getting nothing - as he would still be trying to decide when everyone else had licked clean their sticky fingers - or end up getting a scoop of every single flavor. In the latter case, however, there was still the problem of which order to eat the scoops. There are <span class="math inline">\(20!\)</span> ways, which is a very large number, and that doesn’t count the number of ways if you can eat a bite of strawberry siesta, then a bite of banana bonanza, then a bite of strawberry siesta… All the ice cream would melt before he decided.</p>
<p>ME: He’s not the only one. Seriously, they need to institute a time limit at Cold Hills.</p>
<p>PROF. RANDO: Ice cream was, however, the least of his worries. Decitis almost flunked out of Philosophocle. He had trouble on multiple-choice tests and even more trouble on open-ended questions, and he also had trouble eating because there were too many options in the dining hall. He couldn’t decide which courses to take, so his advisor had to choose courses for him, and then he couldn’t decide the order in which to do the homeworks. He couldn’t decide when the best time to sleep was, so he would lay on his bed and try to decide whether or not to fall asleep. Sometimes he did make decision successfully, but every decision drained his mental energy. So after he successfully decided that he would have pizza for lunch, he had no energy to go to his afternoon lectures, and would fall asleep in the dining hall.</p>
<p>He went to the Center for Physical and Mental Wellbeing<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> to find a solution.</p>
<p>ME: And they prescribed him a randomizer?</p>
<p>PROF. RANDO: This was in the old days - before we even had randomizers!</p>
<p>ME: Surely this is just a neurological problem that “modern medicine” can take care of?</p>
<p>PROF. RANDO: There was no “modern medicine” back then. And you know how the doctors at the Center for Physical and Mental Wellbeing are. They prefer remedies that are more… organic, more psychological. They redirected him to the Psychological Disorders group in the Psychology department, who redirected him to the Decision Theory group in the Economics department, who redirected him to the “Free Will is an Illusion” group in the Philosophy department, who then redirected him to the Pseudorandomness group in the Mathematics department.</p>
<p>Anyway, the solution was very simple. The mathematicians invented the Randomizer. The first Randomizer was a long strip of paper that was rolled up in a little box, like a measuring tape. Any time Decitis needed to make a decision, he would first number all the choices, and then pull the tape out one notch and read the next number. If the number was “3” and he was in the Cold Hills Ice Cream Shoppe, he would pick the third flavor, which is “Triple Chocolate Trouble.” They didn’t call it a Randomizer, of course. They called it an “Oracle” who knew what was best for him in every situation.</p>
<p>Decitis was cured after that. He obtained balanced and nutritious meals of many different ethnicities at the dining hall, checked out books from the library ranging from “100 recipes for pie” to “A history of Madagascar”, and tried new hobbies such as rock climbing, knitting, and taiko drumming. He still, however, did terribly on multiple choice tests.</p>
<p>Decitis became a famous cook in his dorm - none of his dishes were combinations that anyone had seen before, and soon everyone was asking if they could have a spoonful of his concoctions. His dormmates started carrying spoons in their pockets, so they could steal spoonfuls when he wasn’t looking. Previously, he only wore his high school uniform, but now his wardrobe had clothes of many different colors, and he began to stand out.</p>
<p>Decitis soon became very popular. This is because it is not necessary to be right to be popular - only to exude an aura of confidence that everything one does is right. He became very selective about his friends though - which, unbeknownst to everyone else, were chosen by consulting his Oracle. People asked him how he was so confident about every decision he made, and he told them about his Oracle.</p>
<p>Of course, his followers wanted Oracles of their own, too. Rather than send them to the Mathematics department, however, he declared himself the sole priest who could interpret the results of the Oracle and told them that in order to get the fruits of his decisions, they would have to copy what he did. His followers got into line after him during lunch, and would get exactly the same thing that he got. They sat together at lunch and parroted whatever statements he made.</p>
<p>ME: Sounds like <a href="uniformist-lunch-table.html">another group I know</a>.</p>
<p>PROF. RANDO: It wasn’t the same, though - for example, when an attractive female student named Piper asked Decitis for a date, he consulted his Oracle, who told him to accept. All his followers also said yes - but well, they were too late. And she would turn out to be his downfall.</p>
<p>ME: I can’t imagine who would want to date someone who is so full of himself.</p>
<p>PROF. RANDO: Being a head priest to your very own religion carries a certain kind of charm. Remember, this was in the old days, before the expansion of the Religion department and the establishment of the <a href="how-i-became-a-uniformist.html">Ideologies Fair</a>, before there were more religions than students.</p>
<p>Decitis and Piper were in a relationship for one month, after which Decitis got bored and asked his Oracle if he should stick with Piper. Well, Piper didn’t like being dumped because his Oracle told him to. Being a very resourceful girl, Piper had made a copy of Decitis’s room key, which she used to sneak into his room and look at his Oracle. The string of digits looked random. In anger, she tried to rip the whole strip out, but it had a kind of stopper mechanism so that only let one digit out at a time. The whole mechanism was quite tamper-proof - she would have to take a hammer to break the whole thing. Just when she was about to go acquire a hammer, she looked back over the string of digits - and realized that she had seen them before.</p>
<p>They were the digits of pi.</p>
<p><img src="https://images-gmi-pmc.edge-generalmills.com/9af66937-486a-4a0f-ba5f-184aabb0714c.jpg" alt="Pi pie" style="width:500px;height:282px;"></p>
<p>ME: How delicious!</p>
<p>PROF. RANDO: You see, Piper used to be a math major. It was a pity she had gotten so obsessed with memorizing the digits of pi that she discontinued the study of higher math. We used to have a Pi Recital contest on Pi Day in the Mathematics department, but after she made us stay up all day and night, we’ve capped the number of digits people are allowed to recite at 100.</p>
<p>ME: What did she do with this knowledge?</p>
<p>PROF. RANDO: Piper got a group of Decitis’s enemies. She now knew all the decisions that Decitis would make, so she arranged them to be the wrong decisions. For example, if the next digit were a five, she might have her friend Eiscreemy invite Decitis to the Cold Hills Ice Cream Shoppe, where he would certainly pick the fifth flavor, which is “Fresh Fiery Habanero, now with five times the fire!” If the next digit were a three, she might have her friend Matt Cher rearrange the roster of the Blind Date-a-thon so that Lyra “Lying” Chitter would be the third person matched with Decitis. In advance of a shopping expedition, a team of enemies would reshuffle the spices and seasonings so that he would pick the worst possible combination.</p>
<p>By the time that he had figured out what was going on, he had just finished several multiple-choice final exams with a score of 0%, and flunked out of Philosophocle.</p>
<p>ME: Serves him right. What’s the moral of the story, Professor Rando?</p>
<p>PROF. RANDO: Ah, the moral of the story is to never trust your random number generator, Junali. Because if someone is able to predict your randomizer before you are…</p>
<p>ME: But why would the Mathematics Department give Decitis the digits of pi, instead of something truly random?</p>
<p>PROF. RANDO: There is no true randomness in the world, Junali, only the semblance of entropy. If I were to know the positions and velocities of all atoms, then I could predict the next thought that comes into your brain, Junali.</p>
<p>ME: Why not something… pseudorandom?</p>
<p>PROF. RANDO: Ah, the digits of pi <em>are</em> pseudorandom - to someone who doesn’t know the digits of pi! Anyway, mathematicians have much loftier things to think about than the problems of someone who is unable to decide which ice cream flavor to get! We have much harder problems to deal with, such as “out of the million possible conjectures I could make, which will be beautifully correct?” We simply flipped to a random page in the “Encyclopedia of Mathematical Constants” and asked a grad student to copy the numbers. We never claimed the numbers were random. In fact, we nicknamed it the Decider - it was only afterwards that it became known as the Randomizer.</p>
<p>ME: I’m glad you chose pi. Decitis deserved what was coming to him.</p>
<p>PROF. RANDO: Indeed. There is no blasphemy that tempts the gods - or a jealous girlfriend - so much as proclaiming yourself the head priest of your very own religion! But of course, the primary moral is that if you do use random number generators, you must choose one with strong theoretical guarantees. Otherwise, you may find your actions extremely predictable by your enemies…</p>

  <div class="blog-main">
    <p>Today is the first snow of the new year! I ready my camera, walkie-talkie, and stack of tutorials, all individually enclosed in snow-proof plastic covers (on such topics as How to Build a Snowman, How to Build a Snowwoman, How to Build a Nongendered Snowperson<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, Snow-Angels for Dummies, The Art of Snowball Wars, Snowfort Construction, Hypothermia Public Service Announcement, and Stages of Grief - the last for when the snowcreature eventually melts; it is never too early to prepare), and bundle up before making the rounds.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>At Philosophocle, we pride ourselves on our broad foundational knowledge - we learn the common epistemological structure beneath all fields, so that we can, in theory, learn any new subject quickly. This does, however, not seem to include snowpeople building. I often find extremely intelligent Philosophocler students standing outside in the snow, unsure where to start. They show me their specifications for dream snowmen and snowwomen on sketch paper that is getting wetter as we speak, asking me questions such as, “How do I make a snowball <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> centimeters in diameter?”</p>
<p>“How about putting on some gloves first?” I reply. Indeed, Snow-Angela, a shrewd businesswoman, is taking advantage of the weather to sell snow gear at 10% markup. I give the amateur snowbuilder Snow-Angela’s business card<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>, and tell them to present it at checkout, which will ensure that I get a 9% cut of the profits.</p>
<p>“This is my new best friend,” an enthusiastic (and more competent) snowwoman builder announces. “In fact, I think we are going to get married.”</p>
<p>I take a picture of the snowwomanizer proposing to the snowwoman with a snowring. He tells me to hurry before the snowring melts. I give him a ticket which he can use to claim his photo at the end of the day for one dollar.</p>
<p>“You’d better get married fast,” I tell him, and pass him a “Stages of Grief” tutorial.<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>He glares at me. “Of all the unhelpful things -”</p>
<p>“Try the Philosophocle School of Religion,” I said, more helpfully, “Which denomination minister are you seeking? I’m afraid I don’t have a guide to Choosing the Right Minister for Your Marriage, or a map of the School of Religion (which is a sprawling complex, including several underground tombs where one can get lost).”</p>
<p>“Is there not a traveling minister?” he asks.</p>
<p>“Ah,” I said, “Of course there is. If you don’t mind a mandatory personal <a href="agnostic.html">information session on agnosticism</a>, Agnes will gladly give you a secular wedding ceremony.”</p>
<p>My walkie-talkie crackes, and I answer it.</p>
<p>“Is this the hotline for snow-building help?” a crackly voice asks.</p>
<p>“Yes,” I say. “Step 1. Do you have a warm coat, gloves, hat, earmuffs, scarf, and are they put on the correct extremities?”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes,” says the voice impatiently. “I just bought them at Snow-Angela’s Snow Shack. She told me to page in for a tutorial on how to actually build the snowman.”</p>
<p>“Ah. May I recommend joining the <a href="how-i-became-a-uniformist.html">Uniformists</a>? They have set up an assembly line at Emptiness Field<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>, in front of the Philosophy Department, and will gladly walk you through the process. Use offer code SNOOBI when you join.”</p>
<p>There is a pause. “What is an offer code?”</p>
<p>I am patient. Most Philosophoclers have not had experience with online shopping (preferring to use computer time to read long blog posts on tumblr written by foreigners with existentialist problems and provide free philosophical consultation in the comments).</p>
<p>“It’s a secret password to join the Uniformists,” I say. “Otherwise, they may throw snowballs at you.”</p>
<p>“I wasn’t aware they were so… militant.”</p>
<p>“You never know who to trust when it starts snowing.”</p>
<p>I route the confused snowbuilders to the Uniformists, because they have been building <a href="snowmelt.html">Uniformed Snowmen</a> for generations, and have promised me a dollar for every person I refer. There is a line for new recruits, including a tent set up containing Uniformist T-shirts, Uniformed Snowman specification sheets with plastic snowproof covers<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> (bottom ball 40 centimeters, middle ball 35 centimeters, top ball 30 centimeters, with identical berets, identical branches bent at identical angles, and identical holsters, each with three standard-issue 8-centimeter snowballs), and where <a href="how-i-became-a-uniformist.html#saved-by-uniformism">Not Important</a> will give a practical primer on Uniformist philosophy as it relates to snowmen building. (“Every snowflake is unique. However, although each Uniformed Snowman is made up of thousands of unique snowflakes, each Uniformed Snowman is macroscopically the same. If you’re curious to learn more, I suggest taking Professor Tempera’s Statistical Physics course in the spring semester. If you join the Uniformists, we will provide you with free study guides as well as sample homework answers.”)</p>
<p>Suddenly, a snowball splatters in my face. It is <a href="how-i-became-a-creativist.html">Trevisia</a>, holding a paintbrush in one hand. I run.</p>
<p>“You traitor!” She calls, “How many people have you referred to the Uniformists? I thought you were an Art major!”</p>
<p>What she says hurts me. I am in fact an Art major. Art, however, is an undervalued subject, so I have supplemented it with a business education. The other art majors resent me simply for not being a starving artist, like them.</p>
<p>I try to dodge her paintbrush. Any other day, I am content to be colorful, however, it will not do to refer people to the Uniformists when I am splotched. In my dodging I drop several papers in my stack of tutorials. Fortunately, they are in snow-proof plastic covers; I will pick them up later.</p>
<p>“You and your instructions! Building a snowperson to specifications ruins the creative process that is building a snowperson! A snowperson is not a list of instructions! Every snowperson and snowcritter is a poem! Where are those ‘Let Your Inner Snowcritter Out’ paintings I asked you to distribute?”</p>
<p>“I am happy to distribute anything for you if you pay the distribution fees,” I shout as I run. I do not tell her that I doubt her painting will be popular. It is a picture of a snowperson climbing out from a person’s chest. While it is certainly a piece of artwork, it is not what people are looking for when they ask for instructions on how to build a snowperson.</p>
<p>I trip over an unfinished snowperson’s bottom. To my dismay, while I am down, Trevisia dabs furiously at my new coat with her paintbrush. I sit up, expecting the worst, but Trevisia is staring sadly at her paintbrush, which is frozen. She tries to warm it with her breath. Her mittens are threadbare, and she rubs them furiously to keep warm. I have a sudden desire to give her a business card and coupon for Snow-Angela’s Snow Shack. (I have a limited number of coupons for select customers.) A voice interrupts us before I can make the offer.</p>
<p>“Hey, excuse me,” someone says, “Can you teach me to build a snowman?”</p>
<p>“Are you <em>sure</em> you want to build a snowman?” Trevisia says. “Does the world need another white male? Why not build a snowturtle, giraffe, bear, unicorn, dragon, or dung beetle?”</p>
<p>Trevisia glares at me, daring me to say otherwise.</p>
<p>The lines are well-rehearsed in my mind: <em>May I recommend joining the Uniformists? Use offer code SNOOBI…</em> But for once I don’t say the words.</p>
<p>“A snow dung-beetle? But that sounds really hard…”</p>
<p>“Do not worry about the finished product. Is it not said that ‘Every blizzard begins with a single snowflake?’ And every snowflake, tiny as it is, is unique…”</p>
<p>They walk away, leaving me in the snow. I pick up my brochure. My interests are for today aligned with the Uniformists. They will give me a $100 bonus if at the end of the snowstorm, Uniformed Snowmen constitute the majority of all snowcritters. They are on track to win. An anonymous Uniformist has been paging me with the counts: ninety, one hundred, one hundred and ten…</p>
<p>They certainly seem to have the upper hand. The freelance snowbuilders have been spending one or two hours on each snowcritter, while my snowpeople techniques guarantee assembly in half an hour (terms and conditions apply). For every unique snowcritter I’ve seen, there seem to be at least two snowpeople that are cut out of my common mold. The Creativists have set up an apprenticeship program pairing up wannabe snowcritter builders with Creativist volunteers. Their tutorials involve “showing, not telling,” “learning through failure,” “building your snowcritter with love and care,” and “lying in the snow and letting the picture of your snowcritter come to you,” all of which increase the assembly time. However, there are many more snowcritters unaccounted for, as these artists often eschew public places and carry out their construction in untraveled paths in the woods. The final tally may be close.</p>
<p>My walkie-talkie crackles. Anonymous is giving me an hourly report. “Using assembly line techniques, we have increased production from 30 snowmen to 40 snowmen per hour,” Anonymous reports, “Unfortunately, we are running out of snow. We are beginning an operation to cart more snow to Emptiness Field…”</p>

<li id="fn2"><p>The business card doubles as a philosophy card. Snow-Angela’s statement of philosophy is: “When life gives you snow, make snowpeople. However, in order to build snowpeople, you must have snowgear. Buy snowgear from Snow-Angela!

<li id="fn3"><p>Some believe that a relationship is more passionate when one is cognizant of its impending demise. With snowpeople, however, passion is not recommended: snowpeople are to be admired from a distance, for every touch hastens the arrival of Stages of Grief.<a href="#fnref3">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>There has been debate about repurposing Emptiness Field as a sports field, which has met with intense opposition from the Philosophy Department. When several students attempted to play a game of football on the Emptiness Field, several philosophy students meditated on the field to protest, not flinching even as the football whistled a centimeter past their noses. The game ended in a draw when one of the philosophy students was hit in the head, and the football players were preemptively flunked from their philosophy courses. This has led the Department of Athletics drawing up a plan to cut down 10,000 square meters of forest for a new field, which then sparked a protest from the Naturalists, led by Trugger, who estimates that about 7 squirrels will be made homeless. The Naturalists are petitioning the Philosophy Department to compromise with the Department of Athletics and come up with a two-department solution to the use of the Emptiness field. This is difficult, as the Philosophy Department does not see eye-to-eye with the Department of Athletics. Indeed, it is often said by disillusioned students that the Philosophy Department sees only eye-to-eye with the crows who roost on the pinnacles of the Philosophy Tower.<a href="#fnref4">↩</a></p></li>

    <p>Fall brings with it a melancholy. No longer do the students tread lightly, but rather, with hands tightly holding on to the straps of their backpacks, weary of impending desolation. For soon the snows will fall, covering campus with uneven lumps of white. We will watch the squirrels journeying through the snow, searching for forgotten treasures that they will never find.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>It is tempting, at times like this, to take our own stashes of almost-expired nuts, to drop a trail of them through the woods, and watch the squirrels follow the nuts, cramming them into their overstuffed cheeks, never once looking up to question the source of the gifts bestowed upon them. However, as is said, “feed a squirrel for a day, and it will eat trash for a lifetime.” For life does not rain down nuts on the snow, and if we feed squirrels, we will inevitably ask, “Who will feed us?”</p>

  <div class="blog-main">
    <p>The Department of Soulmates is an important part of the WholeBeing center. When the ancients say, “You are only half a person,” they are not talking in doublespeak. Philosophocle, as an institution of learning, has been traditionally hostile towards romantic relationships, viewing them as a distraction, outside of certain inbred groups (the Sexists, the Poly House, and the <a href="http://holdenlee.github.io/philosophocle/posts/creativist-love.html">“Concocters” subfaction</a> of the Creativists). Those that hold up signs before lunch, “Date me for lunch today!” are often given <a href="http://holdenlee.github.io/philosophocle/posts/uniformist-lunch-table.html">icy glares</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Instead, the Department of Soulmates offers a “safe space” to talk about romantic relationships. The walls are rainbow-colored, and we have buckets of paint in storage if you desire to make them more colorful. (We also have coupons for hair-dying salons.) The “matchmaking” aspect is most familiar to students. We offer two bulletin boards for this purpose, titled “Looking for soulmates” and “Looking for sexmates”, as well as colored markers, post-it notes, and cards for you to write your “looking for…” message. We offer relationship counseling, no matter how many there are in your party. (We urge you to come to us before your relationships get out of hand. We know that people in the Poly House prefer to manage their relationships on their own, but we are here to help. In fact, the Department of Soulmates was started by Keena Rihillis, an early member of the Poly House.)</p>
<p>We offer a study room. Several students say that it is their favorite place to study, not just because of the rainbow-colored walls, but because they are free to think romantic thoughts. When they outburst statements like “I wish I could break up with my thesis to get a real girlfriend!” they are not met with nearby studiers writing “BE QUIET” or “DIVORCE IS IMMORAL” on sheets of paper torn out from their notebook and pushed towards them passive-aggressively, but snaps of fingers and “Yeah, I feel for you!” You are free to smile or wink at fellow studiers of the same or opposite sex.</p>
<p>You will find there many singles, couples, as well as several multiples. We also have “solitude necklaces,” which you may wear if you do not wish to be looked, smiled, or winked at. (While we cannot enforce this custom outside of the Department of Soulmates, you can be assured that you are safe within our rooms.)</p>
<p>Many students cite “not knowing where to start” or “not knowing what my goals would even be” as a turn-off from having a romantic life. In this case, we recommend that you drop by to pick up a brochure and sign up for a thirty-minute session with one of our many counselors. While those thirty minutes could be used to read thirty more pages of Feller’s tome on Social Ethics, that use of thirty minutes is unlikely to result in finding the other half of yourself.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Surely you cannot anticipate what all the chapters of your thesis before you start—the same is true of relationships. We are here to help you all the way.</p>

  <div class="blog-main">
    <p>Today is Coming-Out Day at the Scoop. Coming-Out used to be just for LBGTQ’s, proclaiming their sexual identities to a religiously hostile culture.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>However, it had over time, grown to be a common occurrence, so much so that I once overheard:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I want to let you know, Lisa, that I am lesbian! I have struggled with this identity -”</p>
<p>“Please, spare me the hells! I’ve had three friends ‘come out’ this week, and I’m tired of listening to their damn spiels, like they are someone fuckably special! In fact, on this so-called ‘coming-out’ day, the person who I was dating told me ‘I’m gay,’ and then next day, told me ‘Oops, just kidding!’ Well, oops, I was just kidding about our relationship!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Naturally the queers were horrified at this lackadaisical attitude and sought to restore sanctity to the act of Coming-Out. After many tea-seeped discussions in the padlocked, rainbow-colored “safe space” in the <a href="department-of-soulmates.html">Department of Soulmates</a>, they concluded that Coming-Out met a chilly reception because what fun is Coming-Out if it is something that happens to many of your friends, but not to you? Why should coming out be restricted to sexual identity? Are we not all affected by a phantom identity that we imagine other people imagine that we have?</p>
<p>Tonight, the <a href="the-scoop.html">Scoop</a> is packed yet quiet. Tonight, you do not need a membership to get cookies, and the bakers are working overtime, their ovens filled to capacity, their arms sore from mixing batter. The chairs are all taken, even the baby stool, the chair that folds when one tries to sit on it, and the dangerously unstable uni-chair. Hanger-bys sit on the floor, here to listen to their classmates reveal their secrets, armed with notebooks, because it is very impolite indeed to forget a person’s new identity, and there are so many people.</p>
<p>Some of them look unfriendly behind their dark sunglasses and padlocked notebooks with monstrous-looking skin - the secretaries, perhaps, of the more traditional religions, here to append names to their ever-growing blacklists. They, too, are welcomed to the Scoop and given rainbow-colored mugs and cookies with generous doses of (all-natural) food coloring. After all, hostility only heightens the stakes.</p>
<p>Lena in eir rainbow-colored hair, and Robin with its arms on its hips<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> , stands at the center, and tells the story of how hard coming-out used to be.</p>
<p>“Everyone has been leaking their true identities, but tonight is the night to unplug the dam!”</p>
<p>The Speaking Stone passes and everyone talks, one by one.</p>
<p>Some say simply their new identity - or the identity they always had but never revealed. That is the only required statement. Others spin out entire stories, the dilemma of deciding. There are gays, lesbians, bisexuals, and transsexuals.<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> There is the standard slew of major changes. The ones that cross the largest chasms get the most applause, especially from the welcoming side: literature to mathematics, engineering to philosophy, technology to music. People whose paths cross in different directions clink cups together, “let’s talk sometime.” There is another slew of religion changes. Some give tortured stories of the lies and questions that have weighted them down through childhood, and the light of Rationality that saved them; others talk about how they escaped the analytically stifling culture around them through the infinite embrace of the transcendent.</p>
<p>Here are some highlights.</p>
<hr>
<p>“Up to this point in my life, I have said yes to everything. I have said yes when my mom said, ‘I think you should go to Philosophocle, that’s way better than Princeton, I’ve never even heard of thata place!’, when my roommate asked me, ‘Can you clean my room for me?’ and when Rhina asked me, ‘Would you like to build a snow-giraffe?’ From today on, I will say NO to everything. Someone, ask me a question!”</p>
<p>“Will you say no to this question?”</p>
<p>The wannabe naysayer opened his mouth and hesitated for several seconds. A big grin spread over the asker’s (an amateur Logicist) face.</p>
<p>“NO!” the naysayer shouted.</p>
<p>The Logicist fainted, and everyone else clapped.</p>
<hr>
<p>“I object to this ceremony on philosophical grounds! All binary distinctions are illusory! There is no male or female, unisexual or bisexual, Creativist or Uniformist, day or night, reality or illusion. There is no color! There are no words! There is only the One!”</p>
<p>Everyone looked at each other confusedly, before realizing that the speaker was not, in fact, coming out as anything, and he was speedily escorted off the premises by the campus police.</p>
<hr>
<p>“This will be the last Scoop cookie that I eat. From now on I am vegan.”</p>
<hr>
<p>A student holds up a sign, “I will now be silent.”</p>
<hr>
<p>“I used to be part of the Society for Traditional Family Values, and very anti-sex. However, I met a certain mysterious stranger in the <a href="the-street.html">Electric Eel</a>, who convinced me otherwise. Now I think sex is a lot of fun, and I am officially a Sexist! I’ve put a posting on the Department of Soulmate’s ‘looking for sexmates’ bulletin board, please check it out!”</p>
<hr>
<p>“I’ve wondered off the path, of my previous major, math. Now I declare: I study English, less logic gives me much more space to wish.”</p>
<hr>
<p>“I’ve decided that I won’t be white anymore. It’s so boring! I’ve decided to be Native American.”</p>
<hr>
<p>A girl with a computer in her arms stood on a chair and said, “I was going to major in Technology, but here’s what I think of it now,” and dropped the computer on the floor.</p>
<p>“I thought, why am I trying to program this mechanical mind when I don’t even understand my own? I declare that I am a philosopher.”</p>
<p>Dave, the techie, rushed forward and cradled the broken computer in his arms. “Do you know how rare technology is on this campus??? You could have donated it to me instead!” He left for the Technology department, no doubt to gut the piece of technology for spare organs.</p>
<hr>
<p>“Rather than be a student, I’ve decided to be a gamer. We’re having an all-nighter playing video games in the Technology room! Please join us!”</p>
<p>It is good that Dave has just left. He prefers for technology to be used in <a href="bloodfields.html">morally justified ways</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>At the end come the people who are not so much coming out, as much as making resolutions.</p>
<p>“I will eat healthier!” announces an obese student, “I will be an earlier sleeper!” announces a girl in pajamas, “I won’t be a slacker, I’ll be a nerd!” announces a boy who is attempting to start being a nerd by carrying a heavy pile of books in his hands, and “From now on, I will tell the truth!” says a student who got a grade of M- (needing a moral education) in Social Ethics last term. “I’ve been a goody-goody but not I’ve decided not to give a shit about anything anymore!” announced an exchange student.<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>The applause is less warm, because the speeches are less thought out. Perhaps these bandwagoners just want the free T-shirt that Lena passes out to every Comer-Out, but we give them the benefit of the doubt.</p>
<p>The T-shirts are blank except for the words, “I am.” Permanent markers are passed around. Every participant must then change into their new T-shirt<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>.</p>
<p>All Comer-Outs must wear the shirt for the next day. Otherwise, they will be considered to have reneged on their identity, and the Scoop bakers will give them “cold tea”, offer frowns instead of cookies, and demand “Who do you think you are?” rather than greet them with “Hi! Welcome to the Scoop!” Shu-Gar, the Scoop’s official memorizer, stares hard at every Comer-Out, committing their faces and characteristic speaking tics to memory.</p>
<p>The coming-out ceremony has a strong effect on foreigners. Many of them start crying, and mumble things like, “if only it were so easy.” We pay them no attention, except that Lauren will refill tea cups and pass out rainbow handkerchiefs. At the end, if there are T-shirts left, Lena will leave some on the table, and some of the foreigners will take the shirts, huddle over them, and write secret identities not yet ready to be shared, before stuffing the T-shirts in their backpacks and hurrying out, as if they were time bombs, which of course they are.</p>

  <div class="blog-main">
    <p>A public elevator has been installed in the library! There was much debate about whether its installation would discourage physical activity—climbing stairs with an armful of books works out both your arm and leg muscles, while standing in an elevator does neither—and whether we would create another fault line for our already splintered student body—perhaps they will call themselves Walkers and Riders. (We have planned for this eventuality, so there is a temporary moratorium on any application for founding religions which make significant mention to either stairs or elevators.)</p>
<!--more-->
<p>To compensate, and to increase the appeal of the elevator to those who might otherwise show off their physical prowess, the elevator has been set to slow speed. It takes thirty seconds to go from the first to the second floor. “Meet someone new—take the elevator today!” the posters say. We believe that the thirty seconds in an elevator when you have nothing else to do will encourage you to interact with the other strangers in the elevator, perhaps by asking them penetrating questions or engaging in a thirty-second improvisational scene. (Creativists and Dramatists have expressed excitement over this development—I wonder what they have in store!)</p>
<p>(Disabled students need not worry. The helpful library attendants will more than happily carry you up the stairs, or classify you as a book so you may temporarily use the BOOKS ONLY service elevator.)</p>

  <div class="blog-main">
    <p>As old and new Philosophoclers alike settle on campus, I would like to take the opportunity to welcome our new exchange students!</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The whole campus is excited. The past few days, we have been poring over the meager biographies they have proffered us; Sygoh, who studies Psychology, has been inferring their personality types; and the <a href="housing-optimization.html">Housers</a> have been staying up in the evenings trying to fit them into the dorms.</p>
<p>We first thought to put all the exchange students in Modern Grey—the new, air-conditioned dorm—but the <a href="uniformist-lunch-table.html">Uniformists</a> protested, saying that it made the new students Stand Out, and besides, don’t Philosophocle students deserve the best of our Housing? Furthermore, putting all the exchange students together would reduce opportunities for cultural assimilation and increase the risk of tribalism. Is not an exchange program the best time for personal growth?</p>
<p>Thus the Housers have unanimously agreed to put Brian, who wants the “authentic Philosophocler experience” and is “up for anything,” in the top<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> floor of Riversky, the old, run-down dorm farthest from central campus. The Housers traditionally give higher priority for Riversky to those who get a grade of M- in one of their classes (“Needing a moral education”).</p>
<p>Each exchange student has been assigned a Shadow. (We first thought to call them Friends or Buddies, but Lukko pointed out: what if it is not a friend that the students need, but a rival or a critic? Moreover, an assigned friend is unnecessary when there is a healthy economy for friends—be sure to nab your “<a href="how-i-became-a-creativist.html">free friend</a>” card at the <a href="how-i-became-a-uniformist.html">Ideologies Fair</a>.) Onto a Shadow, however, one can project both one’s innermost desires and deepest fears.</p>
<p>A reminder to our Shadows: Please resist the natural urge to force your religion onto the exchange student, and give them freedom of religious choice. It is better for them to choose their own religion and be your enemy, then for you to choose it for them and become their friend! Do not forget that the <a href="agnostic.html">lack of a decision is itself a choice</a>.</p>

    <p>Today is move-out day. I watch the Uniformists leave together. They will split up at the train station, but not before each Uniformist gives each other Uniformist a hug and says, “Although we will be apart, we are always one and the same.”</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The <a href="how-i-became-a-creativist.html">Creativists</a> will leave separately, each using a different mode of transportation, whether it is running, skipping, jumping, hopping, hopscotching, bouncing on a pogo stick, bicycling, unicycling, tricycling, skateboarding, rollerskating, cartwheeling, sitting on a shopping cart being pushed by a friend, skiing (difficult in this weather), topsy-turvy (imitating the antics of drunk people they have seen in foreign films), or closing one’s eyes as one walks and imagining that one is floating on a magic carpet, rather than walking.</p>
<p>It is good that each religion has its way with coping with goodbyes. For the Uniformists, there is no goodbye because goodbyes can only be between people who are different. The Creativists, on the other hand, are too preoccupied with creating to be sad.</p>
<p>I am helping the Waverers today as they wave goodbye to every individual as ey leave campus (note that the Uniformists are treated as one individual). I help them by delivering beverages. Today is a hot day, so I deliver lemonade, juice, and the occasional bottle of “iced tea” (or hot tea, for the more stalwart/traditional).</p>
<h2 id="who-are-the-waverers">Who are the Waverers?</h2>
<p>“Who are the Waverers?” Fron asked me during walk-in office hours on Thursday.</p>
<p>This was his second question. The first was “What’s the meaning of wearing a U-shirt above rainbow Creativist pants?”</p>
<p>“As an <a href="agnostic.html">agnostic</a>, I prefer to mix the best parts of each religion,” I said. “Please sit down, have some tea, and tell me about your religious troubles.”</p>
<p>To answer his question, I led him to the window and pointed to a boy standing on the grass. When someone passed, the boy would run over, wave to them, and shout something. The passerby would then look plesed.</p>
<p>“That is a Waverer, Fron.</p>
<p>“The Waverers used to be called the Wavers, because that is what they do. I’m not sure why their name changed. It may be that many people confused waving with wavering, thinking that waving implied wavering—that a person who paid complete attention to other people didn’t have solid ideals to stand on themselves. This is, of course, false, because paying complete attention to other people is an ideal in itself.</p>
<p>“Their name may also derive from their body motion—the Waver/Waverers were often so caught up in waving that they actually rocked back and forth, or ‘waver.’</p>
<p>“But the Waverers embraced their nickname. ‘It is good to waver and be unsure about ourselves,’ they say, ‘because we are not so important. Other people are more important. That is why we wave to them.’ As long as their name does not become ‘Wavererers’, which is positively titillating and grammatically nonsensical, they will be happy.</p>
<p>“Waving is hard work. The Waverers maintain extensive notes about students’ inner lives, culled from Housing forms (many of the Waverers have been Housers at some point), careful observation, memorized conversations, educated guesses from anonymous posts on the ‘Missed Connections’ board, as well as non-anonymous posts on the ‘Looking for soulmates’ and ‘Looking for sexmates’ boards in front of the Department of Soulmates (upstairs). These notes are in padlocked file cabinets only accessible by those who have proved themselves to be worthy Waverers (for the potential of abuse of such private information is enormous).”</p>
<p>“Housers? Does that mean that the Waverer who waved at me <a href="housing-optimization.html">Optimized my Housing</a>?”</p>
<p>“No one person Optimizes your Housing, Fron, just as no one neuron in your brain makes you desire to read books, search for deeper meaning, or order cheese from France. The results of Housing Optimization cannot be said to result from the actions of any Houser. But we digress. Why do you ask, Fron?”</p>
<h2 id="peering-into-the-glass-walls-of-frons-mind">Peering into the glass walls of Fron’s mind</h2>
<p>Fron explained to me that he had not been to a Uniformist lunch table since the Showdown. It felt very odd to not belong to any group, and he felt lonely on the walk to his last final exam. Rather than review the material in his head, he thought about the U-shirt he had stuffed in the corner of his laundry bag. What should he do with it? He considered donating it, but did not wish to corrupt an innocent mind into joining the Uniformists. He considered modifying the U-shirt, but that align himself with Creativist; although Fron was no longer a Uniformist, neither was he a Creativist.</p>
<p>For the first time, Uniformists ignored him. No longer did they yell, “Hi, you!” as they pass by, and neither did he yell, “Hey, you!” at them.</p>
<p>As he was musing, someone called, “Hi, Fron!”</p>
<p>A girl in a bright green shirt was waving at him.</p>
<p>Intrigued, Fron detoured in order to come closer.</p>
<p>“Where do I know you from?”</p>
<p>“You don’t know me,” she said, “But I know you!”</p>
<p>“Are you Pearl?”</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>“I strive to know everyone.”</p>
<p>She gave a little bow.</p>
<p>“It may seem like few people share your vision for beauty in the world, but do not lose hope, Fron. Keep following the luminscent jellyfish inside your head. Now I will be off to greet other friends.”</p>
<p>“Wait! Who are you?”</p>
<p>She gave him a philosophy card<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, which said simply “Waverer.”</p>
<h2 id="i-advise-fron">I advise Fron</h2>
<p>“Meeting her raised my spirits,” Fron said, “Had I not run into her, my bad mood could have worsened my performance on the exam.”</p>
<p>I nod. It is surprising how a fellow student waving and calling out one’s name can raise one’s spirits, lifting one out of a morning depression. More tangible effects like better grades are also not uncommon.</p>
<p>“But, alas! Every time I meet someone beautiful,” Fron lamented, “She disappears so quickly!”</p>
<p>“Waverers strive to know many people. They do not have much time for each person.”<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>“I did not mean to talk about the Waverers,” Fron said, “I came to inquire about the <a href="the-rhymist.html">Rhymist</a>.”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid I don’t know any more than was in Junali’s Philosophocler article SHOWDOWN AT THE SCOOP. I’m sure that you know more, having been present at the Scoop during the <a href="showdown.html">Showdown</a>.”</p>
<p>“Rhymism. What do you know about Rhymism?”</p>
<p>I pushed my rolling chair over to the Religions file cabinet and looked under “R”.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. There is no registered religion called Rhymism. There are Rhetoricians, and the Rhomboids, but that’s defunct.”</p>
<p>“In that case, I would like to establish the religion of Rhymism.”</p>
<p>I took out a “FFFR” form, “Form for Founding Religions.”</p>
<p>“Please describe the core tenets of your religion,” I said, “Detail the rituals and traditions on page 2, symbols on page 3, describe its conceptions of life, death, presence or absence of god or gods, the void, time, how to live a virtuous life, the existence of free will, consciousness, and the plausibility of artificial intelligence on pages 4-9, or alternatively, explanations on why these are not the right questions to ask and what <em>are</em> the right questions to ask in Form B, list the important prophet(s) and their roles on page 10, and attach a holy book describing the religion in detail. Sorry, some of the terminology is quaint. You may substitute ‘leader’ for ‘prophet’ and ‘brochure’ for ‘holy book.’”</p>
<p>“I think you’re making it too complicated,” Fron said. “Rhymism is very simple. It’s about harmony. If the true Rhymist were here, she could explain it to you in rhyme.”</p>
<p>“Well, it seems prophets do have a bad habit of disappearing. I do sympathize with you, Fron, but establishing a religion takes some thought. May I recommend Professor Devou’s class, Religion 101? Many founders have been inspired by this class.”</p>
<p>Fron scrunched up his eyebrows as he looked through the form. I imagined he would have the same expression if he were looking at a distasteful essay prompt in a class he desperately wanted a good grade in.</p>
<p>“Could I offer you an alternative?” I asked. “If you are overwhelmed by the level of devotion needed for a religion, <a href="agnostic.html">perhaps you are an agnostic</a>. At first, being an agnostic is dizzying, like walking on a glass floor on the upper levels of a busy palace. But soon, you may find that wandering through this palace and watching other people’s trajectories as they follow their religions is more enriching than following a religion of your own.”</p>
<p>Fron shook his head.</p>
<p>“Thank you very much, Agnes, but I hope to return to you with an account of Rhymism.”</p>
<p>I nodded. “I will be eager for the increase of diversity of religions on campus.”</p>
<h2 id="final-goodbyes">Final goodbyes</h2>
<p>I am sad that I cannot help the Waverers with more than just delivering beverages. Memorizing people’s names, faces, and deepest desires takes more devotion than I am capable of as an agnostic. I did, however, take the opportunity to wave to Fron (as well as some of my other clients), wishing him good luck in his spiritual journey.</p>
<p>Finally, the last non-Waverer students dribble out of Philosophocle.</p>
<p>I still have one last question, though, before the Waverers wave me goodbye.</p>
<p>“After everyone has left, who waves to the Waverers? Do you wave to each other?”</p>
<p>Wyverra, the leader of the Waverers, shakes her head. “The Waverers do not wave to themselves. No one waves to the Waverers. We must always remember: it is more important to wave to others than to ourselves.”</p>
<p>I am humbled by the Waverer’s waves as I take my leave. If only there were more such religious groups on campus! Next year, I must do more to promote an atmosphere of religious harmony.</p>

  <div class="blog-main">
    <p>It has been more than a week since the showdown at the Scoop. The Scoop is still closed, and the Rhymist is still nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>What happened? I will explain.</p>
<!--more-->
<h2 id="we-enter-the-scoop">1 We enter the Scoop</h2>
<p>At 8am last Tuesday, the Uniformists trooped into the Scoop. We each took a folding chair from the stack, unfolded it in front of the table, and sat down.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>We queued in front of the hot water machine. Each Uniformist took an identical cup from the counter, put in a bag of English Breakfast Tea, and then filled the cup with hot water. We each took one cookie (3cm in diameter, with 5 chocolate chips). We recognized one of our number behind the counter. He greeted us.</p>
<p>“How has your morning been?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Good. I woke up tired, but then remembered that today is the first Uniformist Day at the Scoop, and was heartened. I look forward to your cookies.”</p>
<p>Three other Scoopers sat behind the counter, watching us or reading The Philosophocler. Two of them also wore U-shirts. They looked slightly uncomfortable. They were not regulars (besides their shirts, they were non-uniform), but rather wore the shirts to make us feel welcome. We let them know our appreciation.</p>
<p>“Thank you for <a href="emergency-chaosing.html">making today Uniformist Day</a>,” we told them, “Thank you for the tea. You look good in that U-shirt. Please feel free to join us.”</p>
<p>The last Scooper wore a plain gray shirt, but the black U was absent, and the shirt was the wrong shade of gray. Her hair showed signs of having been dyed. (It’s not so easy to remove signs of Creativism.) She ignored our greetings.</p>
<p>“How are the cookies?” we asked each other.</p>
<p>“They are delicious. The texture is consistent.”</p>
<p>“How is the tea?”</p>
<p>“I have not tasted it yet, as it is hot. However, it smells fragrant.”</p>
<p>Un walked up to the chalkboard. It was empty—all the drawings of cartoon characters, improvisational poems, quotes urging readers to “go their own way” or “follow their hearts”, quadrilingual ramblings, and challenging mathematical equations having been erased by the Scoopers before we came. Un wrote in large letters, “WE ARE ALL HUMAN.”</p>
<p>We nodded.</p>
<p>“Well written.”</p>
<p>Finally we sat down.</p>
<h2 id="the-rhymist-arrives">2 The Rhymist arrives</h2>
<p>Before we started drinking our tea, however, we heard a cheerful creaking of floorboards, and found that a girl in red, holding a piece of bread (rather than a cookie), had joined us. In her other hand she held a mug, on which sat a ladybug.</p>
<p>“Heya,” she said, “I said I’d be back, to help you with what y’all lack.”</p>
<p>Un stood up. After the <a href="the-rhymist.html">disaster during Monday lunch</a>, he was prepared.</p>
<p>“Today is Uniformist day at the Scoop. You are welcome to join us if you wear a U-shirt and use the standard sentences from your complimentary copy of the Uniformist Guide to Conversation. Otherwise, we kindly request that you leave.”</p>
<p>She pulled up a stool (rather than a chair) beside Un and put her bug-mug down.</p>
<p>“You aren’t the only person who has a say,” she said, “I have a right to stay, unless everyone here votes nay.”</p>
<p>Un snatched the girl’s mug and took a sip. We looked at him in surprise.</p>
<p>“Aha! I know it!” Un said, “The Scoopers gave you cold tea!”</p>
<p>Being offered “cold tea” by the Scoopers is punishment for a severe breach of courtesy. It is a signal that one is no longer welcome at the Scoop.</p>
<p>In a smooth motion, the girl took Un’s cup and drank from it.</p>
<p>“As you took my brew, I presume your cup is now mine, while my mug belongs to you. This is strange, but I’ll agree to this exchange. But now you see, you are the one who has drunk cold tea, not me.”</p>
<p>Un’s face turned red.</p>
<p>He stood up, and thirty Uniformists pushed back their chairs and stood up. Alarmed, the girl in red took her slice of bread and Un’s cup, got up, and backed away.</p>
<p>We fanned out in a circle around her. Each one of us held a small U-shirt in our hands.</p>
<p>“Join us or leave,” Un said, moving towards her with the U-shirt held in front of him.</p>
<p>“Let me leave in peace,” she said, “I will depart to Deepsea Teas.”</p>
<h2 id="i-call-out-to-the-rhymist">3 I call out to the Rhymist</h2>
<p><em>Deepsea Teas</em>? That was the cafe with booths separated by fish tanks of deep-sea creatures.</p>
<p>Was she “jellyfish girl”?</p>
<p>The thought washed away my morning Uniformization.</p>
<p>I remembered how Lisa, the girl I had talked to so earnestly at lunch one day, had tricked me into thinking she had been the 3am announcer for <a href="PHSS.html">PHSS</a>, even though her voice was harsh rather than mellifluous, and she was dismissive, rather than appreciative, of life’s many mysteries. Thanks, however, to <a href="re-PHSS.html">Junali’s reporting</a> I had learned of her trickery from this very blog, and also learned that the radio announcer’s real name is Pearl.</p>
<p>Just as she reached the door, I broke the Uniformist ranks.</p>
<p>“Before you flee, beautiful girl, tell me—is your name Pearl?”</p>
<p>She stopped.</p>
<p>“That is a beautiful name—but it is not mine to claim.”</p>
<p>I did not lose hope. After all, Lisa could have lied in the blog post, to throw me off further! The rhyming girl had a quality of speech I have seen in few Philosophoclers. Many speak as if reading a memorized script, or with their tongues like automatic animals disjointed from their brains. Few speak as if they are following a beautiful road inside their head that only they can see.</p>
<p>“Grant me a wish—tell me, are you into jellyfish?”</p>
<p>“They are majestic creatures no doubt. But they’re full of stingers which can give you a lethal clout. I prefer animals less sadistic… and a little more pacifistic.”</p>
<p>My heart fell. But if I could just explain luminescent jellyfish to her…</p>
<p>“You! Get back here!” Un called.</p>
<p>So used was I to obeying the Uniformists that my feed started walking backwards. But I made myself stop.</p>
<p>“Let me tell you a memory I hold quite dear—this will explain my unexpected query. One night I turned on the radio and heard a voice extraordinary. With mellifluity and sibilence, a certain Pearl described the chemistry of of deep-sea luminescence—her voice was music, the quintessence. But soon it faded, like all beauty, evanescent. Since then I have journeyed far and wide, but never until you have I met someone so… rarefied. Speak that thread inside your head, and I will follow in your tread!”</p>
<p>A silence followed. Then, to my surprise, several other Uniformists stepped forward.</p>
<p>“What is your secret? I too want to have your spirit!”</p>
<p>“Tell me what to do, so I can rhyme as well as you!”</p>
<p>“The other Uniformists leer and sneer, but I will protect you, no fear!”</p>
<p>“Please don’t mind Fron, he’s a little obsessed. But with your presence, we are blessed!”</p>
<h2 id="a-suspicious-group-arrives">4 A suspicious group arrives</h2>
<p>Just then, the door opened. Fifteen people entered, all clad in U-shirts, and stood behind red-bread girl. However, the U-shirts all had a blue “2” next to the U, so that they read “U2”.</p>
<p>“How come you are U-shirted,” I asked, “But your shirts look strangely perverted?”</p>
<p>“That’s because we were tired of Uniformism—so we created a schism!”</p>
<p>“We’re not Uniformists—we’re Rhymists!”</p>
<p>“I didn’t know you had a group,” said one of the Uniformists, “can we too be part of the loop?”</p>
<p>“Yes, come with us to rhyme, and you’ll have a good time!”</p>
<p>“Please take a brochure; see all the benefits that you can procure!”</p>
<p>“Leave the Uniformist confines—we’ll give you some fresh new lines!”</p>
<p>“Rhyming is just the start—many more colorful ways to live we will impart!”</p>
<p>“Heart’s content! Time well spent! Things to invent! Leave behind torment. Ascent!”</p>
<p>Several of the Uniformists started to walk away with the “Rhymists.”</p>
<p>Then I saw two faces among the group that I realized. “Wait! Don’t take the bait! These people are not so great. They are Creativists!”</p>
<p>I pointed at Lukko. “My former roommate, who <a href="housing-optimization.html">I have come to hate</a>. Monstrous things he does create, which he uses to intimidate and infuriate!”</p>
<p>I pointed at Lisa. “And that is Lisa who one day <a href="re-PHSS.html">pretended to be</a> the jellyfish girl who so captured my heart. But she was playing a dirty trick on me, feeding me lies for the sake of art!”</p>
<p>My fellow Uniformists backed me up.</p>
<p>“You’re not a Rhymist. You’re a two-timist!”</p>
<p>(One of the Creativists spoke up, “Lukko and Lisa, is that true? This isn’t what Creativists supposed to do!”)</p>
<p>“We won’t join you!” another Uni yelled.</p>
<p>We back away from the Creativists.</p>
<p>“What’s up! Argh, I mean, what a fuckup! I should have put on some makeup!” Lisa said.</p>
<p>“Well, now that our cover is gone, we might as well have some fun!”</p>
<p>Lukko took off his U2-shirt, which had been covering <a href="housing-optimization.html">my monstrosity</a>. All the other Creativists followed suit, and we were accosted by an explosion of color, glitter, glitter glue, metal hooks, plastic eyes, pipe cleaners, bubble-letters, random quotes, beads, buttons, paint, felt, sew-on-pockets, cardboard, cotton balls, flower petals, acorn caps, last autumn’s leaves, feathers dropped from birds in flight, and coconut shells.</p>
<p>Lukko unpacked several canisters of paint from his bag.</p>
<p>“If they won’t become Creativists of their own free will, then colors must spill!”</p>
<h2 id="hell-breaks-loose">5 Hell breaks loose</h2>
<p>Creativists scooped up handfuls of color and charged us. They ran up to Uniformists and dabbed the colors onto Uniformist faces, hair, necks, and shirts. Uniformists with rainbow-colored faces chased after the Creativists, who defended themselves with drumsticks and tambourines. Chairs overturned. Hot tea sloshed through the air.</p>
<p>One of the Scoopers was busy shooting photographs—photographs which would appear in the Wednesday issue of The Philosophocler. Another Scooper—the one with the fake gray shirt—had taken rainbow-colored cookies out of the oven, climbed over the counter, and dunked her hair in paint with the desperation of a thirsty baboon.</p>
<p>I quickly hid below a table, and found that I had been joined by several Uniformists and Creativists, as well as the single true Rhymist.</p>
<p>“This is causing me a lot of stress. Can you tell your Creativists to stop this mess?” said a boy I later learned was Timoo.</p>
<p>“Stop! War is destructive, not creative!” said the girl holding his hand, who I later learned was Rudii.</p>
<p>No one listened.</p>
<p>“I wanted everyone to have fun with rhyme,” the Rhymist said sadly, shaking her head. “But all I did was cause tons of crime.”</p>
<p>“It’s not your fault,” I said. “Campus security will come, and charge the guilty with assault.”</p>
<p>I looked around at the people—Uniformists and Creativists alike—gathered under the table.</p>
<p>“Let them fight their petty rivalry,” I said, “We’ll start our own philosophy. Will you lead us, oh rhyming princess—after, of course, we make our egress?”</p>
<p>The Rhymist put down her cup and bread, and smoothed her shirt of red. She stood up and walked forwards.</p>
<p>“That’s the wrong way!” Rudii yelled. “That’s into the fray!”</p>
<p>“I must remedy what I started,” she said in a faraway voice, “For Moses, the waters have parted.” She walked into the melee.</p>
<p>We lost sight of her.</p>
<p><strong>“I come in the name of peace. Let all hostilities cease!”</strong></p>
<p>“Shut your beaks, the Rhymist speaks!”</p>
<p>“The Rhymist is a two-timist!”</p>
<p><strong>“Stop fighting head to head, let’s play a word game instead!”</strong></p>
<p>“Watch where you’re throwing that color!”</p>
<p>“Don’t holler!”</p>
<p>“Everyone, stop! An unarmed Rhymist’s in our midst, we must desist!”</p>
<p>Uniformists and Creativists stopped. Raised fists were dropped.</p>
<p>We breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>“Where is the Rhymist? <em>Where is the Rhymist</em>?”</p>
<p>“Rhymist, we have stopped. Please speak to us!”</p>
<p>We strained our ears, but did not hear a single line. The only remnant of the Rhymist was the cup and bread she had left with us under the table.</p>
<p>The door burst open. Campus security had arrived. “Everyone out,” a policeman said. “The Scoop is now closed.”</p>

  <div class="blog-main">
    <p>(Monday)</p>
<p>There is a seat missing among us today. One of the regular Unis is sick and cannot come.</p>
<p>A petite girl with a large book of <em>Classical Ballads</em> sits down in the empty chair. She has a taco salad. None of us got a taco salad, because unlike all the other entrees which are eaten with spoon and fork, it is too hands-on. Eating a taco salad would distinguish us from others. She has a side of curried cauliflower, rather than the peppered peas that the rest of us have. She is wearing a blue shirt, not a U-shirt.</p>
<p>We all look at her, unsure how to respond. I wait for another to speak up, but of course, we are all waiting for another to speak up, so none of us do.</p>
<p>“Heya,” she says brightly. “On the surface you look the same/ Makes me wonder what are y’all’s names?”</p>
<!--more-->
<p>She puts down <em>Classical Ballads</em>, and proceeds to crunch into her taco salad.</p>
<p>“Our names aren’t important,” I pipe up, and am not surprised to see two others say the exact same sentence at the exact same time, “As humans, we are all quite interchangeable.”</p>
<p>“I think you’ll find that’s just not true,” she said, “come test time, if you sit in lieu/ of someone else, that’d be quite an oopsy-doo!”</p>
<p>“Stop it,” one of the Unis piped up, “Are you aware what you’re saying is quite taboo?”</p>
<p>“John, don’t rhyme with her, that’ll only encourage the cur,” another pipes up, then colors, realizing he has said John’s name out loud, which is, in fact, quite taboo.</p>
<p>“Are you a Creativist?” another Uni demands. “You’re not welcome at our <a href="uniformist-lunch-table.html">table</a>!”</p>
<p>“It makes me sad to see a group that’s so unstable/ when someone new comes sitting down, she’s quickly slapped an enemy’s label!”</p>
<p>A Uniformist clangs his spoon on the dish. “I must insist that you desist, at this table not a single Creativist is allowed to exist!”</p>
<p>“Everyone, please stop talking,” Un says, “Be calm, I’ll go report this act of stalking.”</p>
<p>Our chewing has gotten out of sync. Panicking Unis are eating their foods out of order—some of us have finished all our peas before our soup, while others have finished our soup before our peas. One of us has dumped peas into his soup. Some of us find our mouths moving without food, as if sounding out silent words. Rather than looking at each other, as Uniformists should, we are all looking at her.</p>
<p>“I am quite curious, if you all eat and dress the same, does that make you spurious?”</p>
<p>“I don’t appreciate your mind game,” one Uniformist growled.</p>
<p>“I am not playing with you,” said salad-ballad girl in blue. “I am merely saying what’s true.”</p>
<p>“Let me explain,” I break in. “Though plain, our lives need no supplement. We are content.”</p>
<p>She looks at me. “You pretend to hide behind an unremarkable life, but really you’re hiding from your internal strife.”</p>
<p>The girl is making sounds with her mouth. She puffs up her cheeks and expels air repeatedly. She snaps her fingers with her non-taco holding hand. We look at her and at each other in confusion: is this some derisory Creativist gesture? The blasts of air and regular snaps, however, draw us in. Listening to it, we again find a rhythm with our chewing. Various Unis speak up.</p>
<p>“You have no place within our bunch. Please let us eat our lunch.”</p>
<p>“You do not belong here. I think this is clear.”</p>
<p>“Your values do not mesh with ours. Leave, before this whole thing sours.”</p>
<p>“Stop!” I say. “Is this the Uniformist way? What merits such a rude display?”</p>
<p>“Fron, she’s turning us into Creativists! We’ve completely deviated from the usual scripts! We’re coming up with new rhymes every time we open our mouth to speak, so everyone, shut your mouths and turn the other cheek!”</p>
<p>I realize that indeed, she is keeping a beat. Our syllables are falling right into her beats, one-to-one, in a way reminiscent of how the Philosophocle Rights and Responsibilities booklet fall into our mailboxes at the beginning of each semester. Unis are drumming on the tables with their fingers, spooning peas every other beat, and opening and closing their mouths like fish.</p>
<p>A Uniformist stands up. We all stare at him. By standing up he has distinguished himself.</p>
<p>“Get out! Or I’ll—I’ll… give you a big clout!”</p>
<p>The girl abruptly stops crunching her taco salad and looks at the offender, who is making threatening arm movements in her direction.</p>
<p>“From your brochure I read that I’d be treated with civility. But since I’ve come I’ve been met with nothing but hostility. Therefore I will now be off, leave behind the halls of lunchtime’s dreary coughs. You can stay and repeat another day—or you can follow the river of what can be said, the song inside your head.”</p>
<p>With this she gets up and starts to leave. She takes her <em>Classical Ballads</em> and taco salad in her hands, leaving her tray behind.</p>
<p>Chairs scrape up as several Uniformists abandon their food, “Please don’t leave without me, I too want to be free!” One Uniformist is busy taking off his U-shirt.</p>
<p>My heart pounds. Should I follow them?</p>
<p>She doesn’t look back. “I do not like what I see. But I am not deaf to your plea. If you want another opportunity, meet me at the Scoop for tea.”</p>
<p>And then she is gone.</p>
<p>“You, you, you!” Un says to the Uniformists who had stood up. “Sit down!”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. I—I—I didn’t know what came over me,” says the boy who had taken off his U-shirt. He hurriedly put it back on.</p>
<p>“Un, we must not go to the Scoop tomorrow,” someone says. “I don’t know what kind of demonic powers that girl has.”</p>
<p>“We certainly <em>will</em> meet her tomorrow for tea,” Un said, his face dark with rage and his fists clenched.</p>
<p>Un had fought tirelessly for <a href="emergency-chaosing.html">“Uniformist Day” at the Scoop</a>. He had written letters to the Director of Religious Life, the Student Activities Board, the Student Judicial Board, the Board Against Discrimination and For Tolerance, and even appealed to the President. Nothing is going to keep him from his rightful place at the Scoop tomorrow.</p>
<p>“<em>All of us</em>. We will teach her that <em>no one</em> messes with the Uniformists. When we are done with her, I promise you, she will be a Uniformist.”</p>
<p>Un sits back in his chair and takes a deep breath to calm himself down. Nods spread around the table.</p>
<p>“Sit down, everyone. Take a breath, in… out… Straighten your backs. Open your books to page ten.”</p>
<p>We take out our pocket-sized Guides to Uniformisms. All of us—even the ones who had previously protested—read page ten<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> out loud. But I cannot return to that previous zen. The girl’s poetry was a unique kind of song. For the first time, I’m not sure that I really belong.</p>
<p>As we read the Uniformization, I don’t process the words at all. They are dull and dreary. I feel I am going through a bleary pantomime. I can’t help but imagine what will happen if every sentence were replaced by rhyme.</p>
<p>There is something beautiful about salad-ballad girl, which none of the other Uniformists understand. Something momentuous, I know, will happen tomorrow. I do not know what, but I know that I cannot allow Un to turn her into a Uniformist.</p>
