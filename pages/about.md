[Holden Lee](http://holdenlee.github.io/) is the webmaster of the Philosophocle blog. He has graciously offered his web development skills to Philosophocle for free because he believes that the wider world will benefit from the unique and valuable perspective of Philosophocler students, faculty, and community members, especially in the domains of philosophy, spirituality, and academics. Furthermore, he wishes that this blog will facilitate cultural exchange between the historically inwardly-turned institution of Philosophocle, and the global community at large. (I.e., please leave comments.)
