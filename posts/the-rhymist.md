There is a seat missing among us today. One of the regular Unis is sick and cannot come.

A girl in blue, holding a screw, sits down on the chair. She has a taco salad. None of us got a taco salad, because unlike all the other entrees which are eaten with spoon and fork, it is too hands-on. Eating a taco salad would distinguish us from others. Neither does she have the side of peppered peas that everyone else has.

We all look at her, unsure how to respond. I wait for another to speak up, but of course, we are all waiting for another to speak up, so none of us do.

"Heya," she says brightly. "On the surface all you look the same/ Makes me wonder what are y'all's names?"

<!--more-->

She puts down her screw, and proceeds to crunch into her taco salad.

"Our names aren't important," I pipe up, and am not surprised to see two others say the exact same sentence at the exact same time, "As humans, we are all quite interchangeable."

"I think you'll find that's just not true," she said, "come test time, if you sit in lieu/ of someone else, that'd be quite an oopsy-doo!"

"Stop it," one of the Unis piped up, "Are you aware what you're saying is quite taboo?"

"John, don't rhyme with her, that'll only encourage the cur," another pipes up, then colors, realizing he has said John's name out loud, which is, in fact, quite taboo.

"Are you a Creativist?" another Uni demands. "You're not welcome at our table!"

"It makes me sad to see a group that's so unstable/ when someone new comes sitting down, she's quickly slapped an enemy's label!"

A Uniformist clangs his spoon on the table. "I must insist that you desist, at this table not a single Creativist is allowed to exist!"

"Everyone, please stop talking," Un says, "Be calm, I"ll go report this act of stalking."

Our chewing has gotten out of sync. Panicking Unis are eating their foods out of order---some of us have finished all our peas before our soup, while others have finished our soup before our peas. Some of us find our mouths moving without food, as if sounding out silent words. Rather than looking at each other, as Uniformists should, we are all looking at her.

"I am quite curious, if you all eat and dress the same, does that make you spurious?"

"I don't appreciate your mind game," one Uniformist growled.

"I am not playing with you," said blue-screw girl. "I am merely saying what's true."

"Let me explain," I break in. "Though plain, our lives need no supplement. We are content."

She looks at me. "You pretend to hide behind an unremarkable life, but really you're hiding from your internal strife."

The girl is making sounds with her mouth. She puffs up her cheeks and expells air repeatedly. We look at her and at each other in confusion: is this some derisory Creativist gesture? The blasts of air, however, draws us in. Listening to it, we again find a rhythm with our chewing.

"You have no place within our bunch. Please let us eat our lunch."

"You do not belong here. I think this is clear."

"Your values do not mesh with ours. Leave, before this whole thing sours."

"Stop! Is this the Uniformist way?" I ask, "What merits such a rude display?"

"Fron, she's turning us into Creativists! We've completely deviated from the usual scripts! We're coming up with new rhymes every time we open our mouth to speak, so everyone, shut your mouths and turn the other cheek!"

I realize that indeed, she is keeping a beat. Our syllables are falling right into her beats, one-to-one, in a way reminiscent of how the Philosophocle Rights and Responsibilities booklet fell into our mailboxes at the beginning of each semester.

<!--
"Stop! We're talking poetry. She's making us into Creativists! Every word we say is Creativist! We must get back the the Uniformist script.

"I do feel a little unrest. But I think Uniformism is for the best."

I notice you didn't get any peas. Have some of mine, if you please.

I saw a vision of what could be. In our Uniformist guide to conversation, every line replaced by a rhyme, right down to the tee!


We, he corrected. We do not know what went over us.

-->

A Uniformist stands up. We all stare at him. By standing up he has distinguished himself.

"Get out! Or I'll---I'll... give you a big clout!"

She stops crunching her taco salad and looks at the offender, who is making threatening arm movements in her direction. 

"Usually you play with the same old toys, but sometimes life gives you another choice. You"d be a fool to pass the opportunity, not to follow a rare splash of peculiarity. Now I"m afraid I must be off, leave the halls of lunchtime"s dreary coughs. You can stay and repeat another day---or you can follow the river of what can be said, the song inside your head."

With this she got up and started to leave. She took her taco salad in her hands, leaving her tray behind.

Chairs scraped up as several Uniformists abandoned their food, "Please don"t leave without me, I too want to be free!" One Uniformist was busy taking off his U-shirt. My heart pounded. Should I follow them?

She doesn't look back. "I do not like what I see. But I am not deaf to your plea. If you want another opportunity, meet me tomorrow night for tea."

And then she is gone.

"You, you, you!" Un said to the Uniformists who had stood up. "Sit down!"

"I'm sorry. I---I---I didn't know what came over me," said the boy who had taken off his U-shirt. He hurriedly put it back on.

"Un, we must not go to the Scoop tomorrow," someone said. "I don't know what kind of demonic powers that girl has."

"We certainly *will* meet her tomorrow night for tea," Un said, his fists clenched. His face was dark. He had been the one who fought for "Uniformist Day" at the Scoop, who had written letters to the Director of Religious Life, the Student Activities Board, the Student Judicial Board, the Board Against Discrimination and For Tolerance, and even appealed to the President. Nothing was going to keep him from his rightful place at the Scoop tomorrow.

"*All of us*. We will teach her that *no one* messes with the Uniformists. When we are done with her, I promise you, she will be a Uniformist."

Un sits back in his chair and takes a deep breath to calm himself down. Nods spread around the table.

"Sit down, everyone. Take a breath, in... out... Straighten your backs. Open your books to page ten."

While all the other Uniformists---even the ones who had previously protested---are reading page ten (The Uniformization, which helps us return to a uniform state after we have been disturbed), I alone don't feel their zen. The girl's poetry was a unique kind of song. For the first time, I wasn't sure that I really belonged.

As we read the Uniformization, I didn't process the words at all. They were dull and dreary; I had read them too many times, I hardly thought about the words. I couldn't help but imagine what would happen if the book were replaced by a book where every sentence rhymed. 

There was something beautiful about the girl, which none of the other Uniformists understood. Something momentuous, I felt, would happen tomorrow.
