It seems like more and more students are converting to either Uniformism or Creativism every day. Much of this can be attributed to [Trevisia](/posts/how-i-became-a-creativist.html)'s  and [Fron](/posts/how-i-became-a-uniformist.html)'s recent fiery posts. Many come to my office during walk-in hours to ask  whether they are more suited for Uniformism or Creativism. "If you have to ask," I tell them, "Perhaps you are [neither](/posts/agnostic.html)."

During this stressful time of year, with thesis deadlines and final exams coming up, students seek a support group. It is not surprising that the Uniformists have swelled in rank: joining requires only a purchase of a shirt and instantly allows the wearer to join the Uniformist group of friends at lunch (especially appealing if one has no friends). Joining the Creativists, on the other hand, requires a heroic effort; although they call it an Initiation, the term "hazing" is more accurate[^f1]; furthermore their meetings are more chaotic then friendly, involving spilled paint, broken voices, collapsing chairs, and rap battles. Recently, however, they are debating whether to allow members to join for a two-month trial period before Initiation. This is a step in the right direction.

Some readers have questioned my neutral status. Is my post on [running](running.html) not a insult to the Uniformists? No, I merely tell the truth as it is. As you can see from this post, I am equally critical to the Creativists and the Uniformists.

Recently, after a lengthy process, the Scoop, traditionally a very Creativist enterprise, has declared that [Tuesdays will be Uniformist day](emergency-chaosing.html). I am pleased with the decision; however, many are not. I am sure that already, the Creativists are planning retaliation. I urged Trevisia not to give in to intolerance, but she merely made a creative face at me and hurried on her way.

I am worried. It is only a matter of time before the Uniformists and Creativists will come to blows again.

[^f1]: Our foreign friends will be familiar with this word, but for those who have never ventured abroad, let me explain. In foreign universities, students belong to "fraternities" and "sororities," which are the analogue of our religions except that they are devoid of ideology. Fraternities and sororities are characterized by a "hazing" process which involves running in the streets naked, drinking copious amounts of alcohol, navigating booby-trapped mazes while blindfolded, being pushed backwards into a lake, and so forth. While the specific activities are different, their essence is similar; the key difference between fraternists and Creativists is that for Creativists, these types of activities are self-inflicted.
