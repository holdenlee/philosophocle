It has been more than a week since the showdown at the Scoop. The Scoop is still closed, and the Rhymist is still nowhere to be seen.

What happened? I will explain.

#1 We Entered the Scoop

At 8am last Tuesday, the Uniformists trooped into the Scoop. We each took a folding chair from the stack, unfolded it in front of the table, and then sat down.[^f1]

[^f1]: The usual Scoop chairs are one-of-a-kind and unreliable, as they were either made by Creativist artisans, or purchased or otherwise acquired on whim by Creativist-aligned Scoopers. The folding chairs, on the other hand, are made in bulk by an unassuming company called Chair Makers. Even for inanimate objects, uniformism is correlated with goodness.
 
We queued in front of the hot water machine. Each Uniformist took an identical cup from the counter, put in a bag of English Breakfast Tea, and then filled the cup up with hot water. We each took one cookie (3cm in diameter, with 5 chocolate chips). We recognized one of our number behind the counter. He greeted us. 

"How has your morning been?" he asked.

"Good. I woke up tired, but then remembered that today is the first Uniformist Day at the Scoop, and was heartened. I look forward to your cookies."

Three other Scoopers sat behind the counter, watching us or reading The Philosophocler. Two of them also wore U-shirts. They looked slightly uncomfortable. They were not regulars (besides their shirts, they were non-uniform), but rather wore the shirts to make us feel welcome. We let them know our appreciation. 

"Thank you for making today Uniformist Day," we told them, "Thank you for the tea. You look good in that U-shirt. Please feel free to join us."

The last Scooper wore a plain gray shirt, but the black U was absent. Her hair showed signs of having been dyed. (It's not so easy to remove signs of Creativism.) She ignored our greetings. 

"How are the cookies?" we asked each other.

"They are delicious. The texture is consistent."

"How is the tea?"

"I have not tasted it yet, as it is hot. However, it smells fragrant."

Un walked up to the chalkboard. It was empty---all the drawings of cartoon characters, improvisational poems, quotes urging readers to "go their own way" or "follow their hearts", quadrilingual ramblings, and challenging mathematical equations having been erased by the Scoopers before we came. Un wrote in large letters, "WE ARE ALL HUMAN."

We nodded. "Well written."

Finally we sat down.

#2 Rhymist arrives

Before we started drinking our tea, however, we heard a cheerful creaking of floorboards, and found that a girl in red, holding a piece of bread (rather than a cookie), had joined us. In her other hand she held a mug, on which sat a ladybug.

"Heya," she said, "I said I'd be back, to help you with what y'all lack."

Un stood up, "Today is Uniformist day at the Scoop. You are welcome to join us if you wear a U-shirt and use the standard sentences from your complimentary copy of the Uniformist Guide to Conversation. Otherwise, we kindly request that you leave." 

She pulled up a stool (rather than a chair) beside Un and put her bug-mug down.

"You aren't the only person who has a say," she said, "I have a right to stay, unless everyone here votes nay."

No one dared look at her. After the previous day, no one dared open eir mouth, lest ey rhyme.

"It's clear that you are not wanted here," Un said.

<!--, and then looked over the rest of us, many of whom eagerly hung on to her words. "I have a right to stay, unless everyone here votes nay."-->

TODO: Do people join her, or are they all against her?

Un snatched the girl's mug and took a sip. We looked at him in surprise. 

"Aha! I know it!" Un said, "The Scoopers gave you cold tea!"

Being offered "cold tea" by the Scoopers is punishment for a severe breach of courtesy. It is a signal that one is no longer welcome at the Scoop.

In a smooth motion, the girl took Un's cup and drank from it. 

"As you took my brew, I presume your cup is now mine, while my mug belongs to you. This is strange, but I'll agree to this exchange. But now you see, you are the one who has drunk cold tea, not me."

Un's face turned red.

Un responded. "Uniformists, we must unite. Seldom do I make a call to fight. But together we must remove this blight!" 

He stood up. The other Uniformists followed. 

<!--"But doesn't this contradict our peaceful ways? The Scoop is a shared space," spoke up one Uniformist.

"Do I hear this right?" Un said, "You support this distinguishing girl from the rest of the group? I declare you no longer a Uniformist!"-->

The girl in red took her slice of bread and Un's cup and backed away. I looked around at the stony-faced Uniformists. Was no one going to support her? But yesterday several Uniformists had; where were they now?

<!-- the scoop is not so free. I will retreat to Deepsea teas-->

"Wait, doesn't this contradict our peaceful ways?" I said, "The Scoop is a shared space."

#3 Heart-to-Heart

Then a thought struck me. What if she were "jellyfish girl"? I now know that Lisa, the girl I had talked to so earnestly at lunch one day, had [tricked me](re-PHSS.html) into thinking she had been the 3am announcer for [PHSS](PHSS.html), even though her voice was harsh rather than mellifluous, and she was dismissive, rather than appreciative, of life's many mysteries. Thanks, however, to Junali's reporting I had learned of her trickery from this very blog, and learned also that the radio announcer's real name is Pearl. Alas, I have no other information.

"Pardon my question, beautiful girl, but is your name by any chance Pearl?"

"That is a beautiful name---but it is not mine to claim."

I did not lose hope. After all, Lisa could have lied in the blog post, to throw me off further! The rhyming girl had a quality of speech I have seen in few Philosophoclers. Many speak as if reading a memorized script, or with their tongues like automatic animals disjointed from their brains. Few speak as if they are following a beautiful road inside their head that only they can see.

"Grant me a wish---tell me, are you into jellyfish?"

"They are majestic creatures no doubt. But they're full of stingers which can give you a lethal clout. I prefer animals less sadistic... and a little more pacifistic."

My heart fell. But if I could just explain to her luminescent jellyfish...

<!--"Please don't mind Fron, he's a little obsessed. -->

TODO: other reactions?

#4 Creativists arrive

(Take off U-shirts?)

Several people had walked into the Scoop, clad also in red.

"If you want to learn to rhyme, join us and you'll have a good time!" said a boy.

"You can rhyme to your heart's content, and all your time will be well spent!"

"Rhyming is just the start of many colorful ways to live that we will impart."

"Please take a brochure; see all the benefits that you can procure!"

<!-- phrases, phases, raises. "You won't have to repeat the same old phrases, you'll sing more types of praises!"-->

"I didn't know you had a group," said one of the Uniformists, "can we too be part of the loop?"

Then I saw two faces among the group that I realized. "Wait! Don't take the bait! These people are not so great. They are Creativists!"

I pointed at Lukko. "My former roommate, who I have come to hate. Monstrous things he does create, which he uses to intimidate and infuriate!"

I pointed at Lisa. "And that is Lisa who one day pretended to be, the girl who so captured my heart. But it was just a dirty trick played on me, lies perpetuated for the sake of art!"

"You're not a Rhymist," a Uni said to red-bread girl, "You're a two-timist!"

(One of the Creativists spoke up, "Lukko and Lisa, is that true? This isn't what we're supposed to do!")

"We won't join you!" another Uni yelled.

I tried to compromise. "Please, we will follow you wherever you lead. Just don't include Lisa and Lukko, I do plead."

"I don't believe in exclusivity. Anyone who rhymes is a friend to me."

"But some people's rhymes are full of spite. They speak of wanting to fight!"

"If they won't become Creativists of their own free will, then colors must spill!" said Lukko.

# 5 Chaosing

He produced several bags of colored powder from his pack. Creativists scooped up handfuls and charged the Uniformists. They ran up to the Uniformists and dabbed the colors onto Uniformist faces, hair, necks, and shirts. Uniformists with rainbow-colored faces chased after the Creativists, who defended themselves with drumsticks and tambourines. The Uniformists chased after their aggressors. Chairs overturned, mugs of hot tea flew through the air.

One of the Scoopers was busy shooting photographs. (They would make it into the Wednesday issue of the Philosophocle.)

A few of us stood by the Rhymist.

"This is causing me a lot of stress. Can you tell your Creativists to stop this mess?" said a boy I later learned was Timoo.

"Stop! War is destructive, not creative!" said the girl holding his hand, who I later learned was Rudii, but one listened to her.
