At the emergency chaosing, Rudii announced to everyone the news I had given her: starting next week, every Tuesday would be Uniformist Day in the [Scoop](/posts/the-scoop.html).

<!--more-->

"How could you have let this happen, Trevisia?"

"I was outvoted. Every few days I suggest to the other Scoopers that we should be an anarchy. They don't listen! The Scoop management remains a democracy."

"How bad is the Uniformist takeover?"

"On Tuesday morning, the Scoopers will erase the board. They will replace the paint-your-own-mugs by forty Uniformist mugs, each gray with a black U, and only offer English Breakfast Tea---no jasmine green, cranberry hibiscus, ginger chili spice, oolong, or rooibos. The Uniformist who has just been trained in cookie-baking---he wouldn't deign to tell us his name, so I will call him Unfun---will supervise the baking, and make sure each cookie has exactly five chocolate chips and is three inches in diameter. 'Different sized cookies are unfair and cause stress,' he says. The Uniformists will come in a horde, because where there's one Uniformist there's always thirty."

The Creativists reacted each in their own way: shuddering, grimacing, clawing at her cheeks, falling off a chair, scratching nails against the blackboard, covering his eyes, unsheathing a cardboard sword, or screaming.

"But the Scoop is open to all," Numms said, "We can all still come. We'll sit at a separate table. We'll bring our own mugs that we painted."

"But Numms, the Scoopers will give 'cold tea' to anyone who breaks the Uniformist atmosphere. For our whole club to get 'cold tea'..."

"Cold tea isn't bad. Why's everyone shitting on cold tea?"

"Not all of us prefer 'cold tea', Lisa."

"We should have taken over the Scoop long ago! Then we wouldn't have to worry about the Scoopers betraying us!" said Lukko.

"Would it really be that bad? We can just stay away; we can still get our cookies the other six days of the week..."

"But we'd have to stay away from the Workshop, too. Would you feel comfy in the Workshop if there are thirty Unifomists above you doing their 'formal tea chant'?"

Rudii held her hand up for attention. "Remember that the goal of Creativists is to make the world a more beautiful place. Does having Tuesdays being Uniformist Day help achieve that purpose?" She didn't pause to listen to our "No's" in sixteen different languages, but continued, "Nor is it wise to

A girl with a shirt of green, and holding a black bean, steps in front of Rudii. I hadn't seen her before.

"Heya," she said, looking around, "it's nice to stumble upon a group so varied, but pray tell: what has you so harried?"

<!--I wonder how y'all do; looking around I see a veritable stew!-->

<!-- "I can't help but hear your troubled tone, I came over to ask: what do you bemoan?"-->

"Hostile takeover! Loss of creativity! Erasure!" Chyme said.

I stepped in front of Chyme before she can talk more. "We're the Creativists. A lot of people tell you that you can benefit society most by following the standard path. But we believe that a life with a single unique attribute is more well-lived than an unoriginal but helpful life. Of course, the more unique attributes the better. Creativism is simply creating, *ad infinitum*." I threw her a plain white shirt from my bag. "As a warm-up you can design your own T-shirt." I pointed at the markers and decorative materials lying around the scoop. "Please make sure it is sufficiently different from everyone around you! Once you are ready, you will need to go through the Initiation..." I held up a new wooden box that I had ready in my pocket.

The girl smiled. "I thank you kindly for that quick debrief---it's good to hear a statement of belief." She turned to Rudii, "But please give me the honor, rainbow chief. I'd like to help you assuage your grief."

"Thank you for your greeting," I said, "But we're in the middle of a meeting."

"Strangers in our midst we'll have to baptize," Lukko said, "For what if you're a Uniformist in disguise? I know they're trying to infiltrate us with spies!"

The girl in green closed her hand around her bean, and took up a somber mien. "Forgive me, but I'm not sure I want to join so soon. I take things slowly, like the waxing of the moon. I thought y'all had some friendly vibes, but I guess you're just another campus tribe."

"Creativists!" Rudii said firmly. "This is no way to treat a guest! We've got to show this girl our best. Just like Timoo here, you're not going to tell him shoo, are you?" She looked pointedly at us, before turning back to green-shirt-black-bean girl.

<!-- She turned back to green-shirt-black-bean girl. "I apologize for our hospitality, but I'll quickly educate you on our mentality." -->

Do you know about the Uniformists?"

"Are they the ones with shirts of gray? I've only seen them from far away. In groups they're quite an imposing display!"

"It's right to be on your toes," Rudii said, "You don't want to get too close. Right now they're trying to take over the Scoop. We can't let them come and---and---" she stumbled, looking confused.

"---leave behind their poop," Lisa finished. Her eyes widened. "Oh, shit! You're doing it!"

"What?"

"You're talking in rhyme! Didn't you have trouble for the longest time?"

Rudii looked at the girl in wonder. "What manner of creature are you?"

"I am someone quite true," she said. "But please, talk not about me, for I come in the service of harmony. I'm tired of all this name-calling; I have in mind something much more enthralling.

<!--But I did not come so you'd be impressed by me. I come in the service of harmony.-->

The plan is this: I sit among them, and they'll ask me 'Have you lost your way, miss?' or cough loudly, *ahem*. I'll start speaking in rhyme. For many, it'll be their first time. My words will seem like magic, and they'll feel their lack of creativism as quite tragic."

"Forgive me for my skepticism," I said, "But you're going to convert Uniformists into Creativism?" I asked.

FizzleGo, the performance poet, was seething with disapproval. He couldn't help but finally show it. "Rhyming isn't the same as Creativism! It's more like... hypnotism! Anyone can rhyme a syllable---true poetry is much more unpredictable. Rhyming is lazy, it encourages our thoughts to be hazy. Rather than putting your ideas in accord, all you have to do is end with the right word. Aargh! Bargh!"

Rudii agreed. "Just because you teach them to rhyme, doesn't mean they'll pick up the creative paradigm."

Lukko spoke up. "I know, you'll be the bait---you'll hold them stupefied. In that malleable state, we'll teach them to create---until they're completely transmogrified!"

Over the next hour we worked out the details. I must stop here, however, 

<!-- "Wait! What about this---

"I'm with you on your plan," Rudii said, "Anything to break up the Uniformist clan. But we need something more detailed. From what I know of Uniformists your proposed dialogue would be quickly curtailed."-->

She turned back to the girl. "I know talent when I see it. Please sit down. What is your name? What does your black bean represent?"

"I'm not going to sit in this chair, all the ones left are a bit of a snare!"

"Amazing! She speaks in rhyme! Not even FizzleGo does that."

FizzleGo was our performance poet. "I speak in poetry, not rhyme. If rhyme were ..., then poetry would be... 

"You must teach me this skill," Rudii said, "This is one aspect of Creativism that I have never mastered."

"It's not too hard to be a bard. Don't think too much. End your sentences with easy words.

it's nice to stumble upon a group so varied, but pray tell: what has you so harried?"

"Hostile takeover! Loss of creativity! Erasure!" Chyme said.

"I'm sorry," I told the girl, "This is a private chaosing for Creativists."

"Fortunately I do feel quite creative. Will you allow me to sit here, though I be non-native?"

"You'll have to go through the Initiation..."

"Leave her be, Trevisia! We've changed the policy on Initiation."

There was a "trial period" where new members could join for two months before having to go through the initiation. My initiation was a transformative experience, and I'm not sure it would have been the same if I'd delayed it by two months.



"I wonder what you all do; looking around I see a veritable stew!"
Together you form quite a crew!

together

I jumped up, "

I've rarely seen a group so diverse, 

"Forgive me for intruding on your meeting," came a voice, "But I would like to offer a word of greeting."

"I'm sorry, this is a private chaosing," Lukko said, "If you want to join, 










Pita, a small girl in a green shirt, stood up.

"I have a plan. No need to panic. At the end, every Uniformist man will be quite manic."

"Pita, I know you've been here since September, but until you carry out the Initiation you're not an official member."

"Neither is Timoo, and you're not going to tell him shoo, are you?" Rudii stared icicles at the offending student, who looked down at his shoes, as was prudent.

Pita has an odd status within our group. She's refused to do the Initiation, but we love her because every time she comes, we re-discover our hidden ability to rhyme. She does something to the atmosphere.

"The plan is this: I sit among them, and they'll ask me 'Have you lost your way, miss?' or cough loudly, *ahem*. I'll start speaking in rhyme. For many, it'll be their first time. My words will seem like magic, and they'll feel their lack of creativism as quite tragic."



"Could you give me a plan that's more detailed?" Rudii asked, "from what I know of Uniformists your proposed dialogue would be quickly curtailed."

I will stop here. I fear I have already said too much.
