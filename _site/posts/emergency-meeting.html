    <p>At the emergency chaosing, Rudii announced to everyone the news I had given her: starting next week, every Tuesday would be Uniformist Day in the <a href="../posts/the-scoop.html">Scoop</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>“How could you have let this happen, Trevisia?”</p>
<p>“I was outvoted. Every few days I suggest to the other Scoopers that we should be an anarchy. They don’t listen! The Scoop management remains a democracy.”</p>
<p>“How bad is the Uniformist takeover?”</p>
<p>“On Tuesday morning, the Scoopers will erase the board. They will replace the paint-your-own-mugs by forty Uniformist mugs, each gray with a black U, and only offer English Breakfast Tea—no jasmine green, cranberry hibiscus, ginger chili spice, oolong, or rooibos. The Uniformist who has just been trained in cookie-baking—he wouldn’t deign to tell us his name, so I will call him Unfun—will supervise the baking, and make sure each cookie has exactly five chocolate chips and is three inches in diameter. ‘Different sized cookies are unfair and cause stress,’ he says. The Uniformists will come in a horde, because where there’s one Uniformist there’s always thirty.”</p>
<p>The Creativists reacted each in their own way: shuddering, grimacing, clawing at her cheeks, falling off a chair, scratching nails against the blackboard, covering his eyes, unsheathing a cardboard sword, or screaming.</p>
<p>“But the Scoop is open to all,” Numms said, “We can all still come. We’ll sit at a separate table. We’ll bring our own mugs that we painted.”</p>
<p>“But Numms, the Scoopers will give ‘cold tea’ to anyone who breaks the Uniformist atmosphere. For our whole club to get ‘cold tea’…”</p>
<p>“Cold tea isn’t bad. Why’s everyone shitting on cold tea?”</p>
<p>“Not all of us prefer ‘cold tea’, Lisa.”</p>
<p>“We should have taken over the Scoop long ago! Then we wouldn’t have to worry about the Scoopers betraying us!” shouted Lukko.</p>
<p>“Would it really be that bad? We can just stay away; we can still get our cookies the other six days of the week…”</p>
<p>“But we’d have to stay away from the Workshop, too. Would you feel comfy in the Workshop if there are thirty Unifomists above you doing their ‘formal tea chant’?”</p>
<!--
ADD CHAOS HERE.

Rudii held her hand up for attention. "Remember that the goal of Creativists is to make the world a more beautiful place. Does having Tuesdays being Uniformist Day help achieve that purpose?" She didn't pause to listen to our "No's" in sixteen different languages, but continued, "Nor is it wise to
-->
<p>A girl with a shirt of green, and holding a black bean, stepped in front of Rudii. I hadn’t seen her before.</p>
<p>“Heya,” she said, looking around, “it’s nice to stumble upon a group so varied, but pray tell: what has you so harried?”</p>
<!--I wonder how y'all do; looking around I see a veritable stew!-->
<!-- "I can't help but hear your troubled tone, I came over to ask: what do you bemoan?"-->
<p>“Hostile takeover! Loss of creativity! Erasure!” Chyme said.</p>
<!--CHANGE TO SOMETHING NEW-->
<p>I stepped in front of Chyme before she could talk more. “We’re the Creativists. A lot of people tell you that you can benefit society most by following the standard path. But we believe that a life with a single unique attribute is more well-lived than an unoriginal but helpful life. Of course, the more unique attributes the better. Creativism is simply creating, <em>ad infinitum</em>.” I threw her a plain white shirt from my bag. “As a warm-up you can design your own T-shirt.” I pointed at the markers and decorative materials lying around the scoop. “Please make sure it is sufficiently different from everyone around you! Once you are ready, you will need to go through the Initiation…” I held up a new wooden box that I had ready in my pocket.</p>
<p>The girl smiled. “I thank you kindly for that quick debrief—it’s good to hear a statement of belief.” She turned to Rudii, “But please give me the honor, rainbow chief. I’d like to help you assuage your grief.”</p>
<p>“Thank you for your greeting,” I insisted, “But we’re in the middle of a meeting.”</p>
<p>“Strangers in our midst we’ll have to baptize,” Lukko said, “For what if you’re a Uniformist in disguise? I know they’re trying to infiltrate us with spies!”</p>
<p>The girl in green closed her hand around her bean, and took up a somber mien. “Forgive me, but I’m not sure I want to join so soon. I take things slowly, like the waxing of the moon. I thought y’all had a friendly vibe, but I guess you’re just another campus tribe.”</p>
<p>“Creativists!” Rudii said firmly. “This is no way to treat a guest! We’ve got to show this girl our best. Just like <a href="creativist-love.html">Timoo</a> here, you’re not going to tell him shoo, are you?” She looked pointedly at us, before turning back to green-shirt-black-bean girl.</p>
<!--Add interaction with TIMOO-->
<!-- She turned back to green-shirt-black-bean girl. "I apologize for our hospitality, but I'll quickly educate you on our mentality." -->
<p>“Do you know about the Uniformists?”</p>
<p>“Are they the ones with shirts of gray? I’ve only seen them from far away. In groups they make an imposing display!”</p>
<p>“It’s right to be on your toes,” Rudii said, “You don’t want to get too close. Right now they’re trying to take over the Scoop. We can’t let them come and—and—” she stumbled, looking confused.</p>
<p>“—leave behind their poop,” Lisa finished. Her eyes widened. “Oh, shit! You’re doing it!”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“You’re talking in rhyme! Didn’t you have trouble for the longest time?”</p>
<p>Rudii looked at green-bean girl in wonder. “What manner of creature are you?”</p>
<p>“I am someone quite true,” she said. “But please, talk not about me, for I come in the service of harmony. I’m tired of all this name-calling; I have in mind something much more enthralling.</p>
<p>“What works for Creativists works for Uniformsits. The plan is this: I sit among them, and they’ll ask me ‘Have you lost your way, miss?’ or cough loudly, <em>ahem</em>. I’ll start speaking in rhyme. For many, it’ll be their first time. My words will seem like magic, and they’ll feel their lack of creativism as quite tragic.”</p>
<!--But I did not come so you'd be impressed by me. I come in the service of harmony.-->
<p>“Forgive me for my skepticism,” I said, “But you’re going to convert Uniformists into Creativism?” I asked.</p>
<p>FizzleGo, the performance poet, was seething with disapproval. He couldn’t help but finally show it. “Rhyming isn’t the same as Creativism! It’s more like… hypnotism! Anyone can rhyme a syllable—true poetry is much more unpredictable. Rhyming is lazy, it encourages our thoughts to be hazy. Rather than putting your ideas in accord, all you have to do is end with the right word. Aargh! Bargh!”</p>
<p>Rudii agreed. “Just because you teach them to rhyme, doesn’t mean they’ll pick up the creative paradigm.”</p>
<p>Lukko spoke up. “I know, you’ll be the bait—you’ll hold them stupefied. In that malleable state, we’ll teach them to create—until they’re completely transmogrified!”</p>
<!--CHANGE: She disappears. Then they fail to rhyme?-->
<p>We talked for a long time more, but the details will have to wait until afer the war. Uniformist eyes are everywhere—and they must remain unaware.</p>
