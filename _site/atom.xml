    <p>While much of the student body is engaged in perpetual mock-wars between different religions (particularly the Creativists and the Uniformists), I would like to take the opportunity to offer an alternative: agnosticism.</p>
<p>People ask why I am agnostic. “Is it not terrifying, to have no solid ideals to stand on?” they ask me all the time.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>“It is like walking on a glass floor on the upper levels of a busy palace,” I tell them. It takes a while for them to imagine a glass floor, as they are used to floors of oak and concrete. “Part of me is afraid of the dizzying height, but another part of me stares with wide eyes at all the happenings revealed through the floor. To me, wandering through this palace and watching other people’s trajectories as they follow their religions is more enriching than following a religion of my own.”</p>
<p>They tell me my religion is close to that of the Wonderers. Indeed, the Wonderers are one of the groups closest to my heart. In case you do not know: they are the ones who you find walking outside in their pajamas when you get up to pee (or listen to PHSS) at 3am in the morning. Perhaps what keeps me from being a true Wonderer is that I have not participated in their insomnia gatherings, being fortunate enough to never have sleep problems (or unfortunate enough to not be able to stay up past midnight). Another philosophical distinction between us is that Wonderers believe very much in trying things, as evidenced by the American children’s book “Green Eggs and Ham” being on their reading list, while I take exception (as I am a vegetarian, there are many foods which I do not try, on principle).</p>
<p>Do you notice students who hold up signs advertising their religions after class and pass out handwritten brochures? Those of us who otherwise have trouble finding conversation partners at lunch know that we always have this recourse. Of course, with them we do not get to choose the topic of conversation. They have learned to talk fast, because they have learned from Introduction to Rhetoric not to give their listeners time to ask questions.</p>
<p>I have enjoyed many of these conversations. Zyndra offered a necklace with a Z made of pale blue stone that would rest coolly on my chest, explaining that as the last letter of the alphabet, Z represented the fact that all Zyndrian followers must have their eyes focused on the spot beyond the horizon, because everything before the last is ephemeral. She genuinely believed her own religion, unlike many of the students who proselytize as their homework assignment for Religion 101, whom I tend to avoid: for example, when I finished my conversation with Brent, he gave a sigh of relief that his homework had been accomplished. Other students, like Sankar, have constructed elaborate mythologies claiming divine inspiration. (I see that Professor Drim’s Awakening Your Creative Self class has been very successful.)</p>
<p>One proselytizer, angered at my unwillingness to convert after taking up several of her lunchtimes voicing doubts to statements she took for granted, told me, “Well, why don’t you start your own religion, and call it agnosticism?”</p>
<p>To her surprise, I took her comment seriously, though not literally<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, and decided to start a job as Counselor for Agnostics at the Wholebeing Center<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>. (It was an interesting experience, filling out a job application for a job I invented myself. At the job interview, I explained to them what I would be doing, which, I am told, is the reverse of what normally happens.) The job has been a pleasure for me: many students who are unsure about which religion to follow want nothing more than a neutral party to listen to the conflicting voices inside their head, and I am more than happy to be the neutral party. For one hour, their heads become like the transparent floors of a glass palace and I am privileged to peer inside, before they once more draw their mental shades and become once more opaque to the world.</p>

    <p>At Philosophocle, there are many paths. There are stairs angling proudly up the hills and sinusoids winding leisurely through the garden. There are zigzags of wheelchair-accessible alternatives, basement tunnels lined with hot-water pipes, ladders hung from trees designated good for climbing, forbidden rooftops (to be traversed only during power outages, when the electricity to the alarmed door cuts off). People have chosen their paths, like Jacob who always chooses the zigzagging path rather than the stairs even when he’s late for class, to remind himself “there are no shortcuts to life”, or Albert, who dreams of being a squirrel, and is still practicing his tree-climbing so he can make it across campus without touching ground.</p>
<p>As I entered the Ideologies Fair, I wondered: what would be my path?</p>
<!--more-->
<h2 id="my-encounter-with-creativism">1 My encounter with Creativism</h2>
<p>A huge crowd had gathered around the Creativist booth.</p>
<p>“Be Diferent! Be Divient!” their sign advertised.</p>
<p>On the left of the table were piles of plain white shirts. On the right was a box containing many tiny little wooden boxes. In the middle was a buffet table of decorations, including glitter, glitter glue, metal hooks, plastic eyes, pipe cleaners, bubble-letter tracers, a Random Quote Box, beads, thread, yarn, buttons, paint, spray paint, felt, sew-on-pockets, cardboard, cotton balls, flower petals, acorn caps, last autumn’s leaves, feathers dropped from birds in flight, and coconut shells.</p>
<p>“A lot of people tell you that you can benefit society most by following the standard path,” said a girl behind the table whose nametag read “Trevisia.”</p>
<p>“But we believe that a life with a single unique attribute is more well-lived than an unoriginal but helpful life. Of course, the more unique attributes the better. Creativism is simply creating, <em>ad infinitum</em>.”</p>
<p>“How can we join?” an enthusiastic freshman asked.</p>
<p>“As a warm-up you can design your own T-shirt,” Trevisia gestured to the buffet table. “Please make sure it is sufficiently different from everyone around you! Once you are ready, you will need to go through the <a href="how-i-became-a-creativist-ii.html">Initiation</a>…”</p>
<p>Trevisia was certainly unique. She wore a hat made of bread, two earrings upon which dangled wire letters A through Z, and a tie-dyed shirt filled with hundreds of eyes, from cyclopean to arachnid to plastic. She sported candy-cane striped hair.</p>
<p>I shifted uncomfortably under the stares of all those eyes. I pointed at her shirt and interjected, “What is the meaning of all those eyes?”</p>
<p>“No meaning,” Trevisia said, “But they do have names. This one is Cycloon, this one is Goliuth, this one is Arakaye, this one is eye4eye…”</p>
<p>I soon tuned out, as the fervent creating all around me led me to the question of, how would I decorate my shirt? My first thought was geometric shapes—but I looked at the boy next to me, and he had already drawn out a hyperbolic tessellation, with the animals of the zodiac embedded inside. I thought to make an acronym of my name, but Kakup had already done that (Kapricious and Kool under pressure). I thought to draw a coat of arms representing various aspects of myself, but the girl besides me had drawn not one but ten, arrayed in some genealogical tree of her identity.</p>
<p>Then I had a brilliant idea. The others had creative shirts, but the shirts were narrow in meaning and scope, like one of the many possible paths on campus. I would make a shirt that encompassed all the possible paths at once. I would use every single ingredient. Already I was mentally appropriating them: the glitter glue would be the stars; the coconut shell would be the Earth; the eyes signified all the life forms, terrestrial and extraterrestrial; last autumn’s leaves represented the inevitable decay of all things beautiful. Finding an empty bit of floor, I sat down and got to work.</p>
<p>It was not until thirty minutes later that I stretched out the shirt in front of me to examine my handiwork—with mounting horror. The shirt was not simply ugly, for it was worse than diseased reptile skin, which although ugly, is at least natural. I cannot describe the <em>object</em> I had created, except to say that even now, as I am thinking about it, I find myself scrunching up my face, breaking out in sweat, and grasping my knees to keep my body from shaking, until I remind myself of the <a href="PHSS.html">existence of luminescent jellyfish</a>.</p>
<p>“That’s beautiful!” Trevisia turned her multitude of eyes on me. “You would make a great Creativist. Why don’t you show the rest of the people here your creation—?”</p>
<p>Could it be? The Creativists were so starstruck with the act of creation that they would sing praises even when one of their kind created a monstrosity?</p>
<p>“Come back, Froggulon—Frobobbon? What was your name again?”</p>
<p>I hurried away, hiding my face. This was the final straw. The Creativists were not content at decorating shirts with all manner of unnatural appendages, they also had to decorate my name with all manner of unnatural consonants!</p>
<p>So eager was I to exit the Ideologies Fair that I would have barreled right through the exit had not I heard a voice, “Looks like we lost another one to the Creets!”</p>
<h2 id="saved-by-uniformism">2 Saved by Uniformism</h2>
<p>Eager though I was to escape the ignominy of unsuccessful creation, I would not have it be said that I was a “Creet”! The source of the voice was a girl behind a plain wooden table, in a gray shirt with a large black U in the middle. She had on a name tag with “My name is Not Important.” A boy sitting beside her had the same shirt, but with no name tag.</p>
<p>Noticing my attention, Not Important said, “Welcome, fellow student! May I see your shirt?”</p>
<p>I turned so I was facing the table. “What, this?” It was a shirt that said, PHILOSOPHOCLE: <em>A PINNACLE OF HIGHER EDUCATION</em> in lofty letters, amidst a background of clouds and pinnacles.</p>
<p>“No, the shirt you just made.”</p>
<p>Not Important winced and shielded her eyes. Unnamed stared at the shirt, looking but not seeing.</p>
<p>“My feeling is the same,” I assured Not Important.</p>
<p>Unnamed spoke up, “Such are the fruits of unbridled Creativism.”</p>
<p>After he spoke, I heard a beep. In front of the Creativist booth, someone stared intently at a slip of paper, before throwing it aside, and started warbling opera in a language that no human could understand. Not Important winced again. Unnamed handed me a pair of earplugs, which I gratefully plugged in. Not Important and Unnamed followed suit.</p>
<p>Unnamed offered me a T-shirt and a brochure.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every day the world around us pressures us to be unique—to talk in a different style of poetry in order to mark ourselves as having high artistic taste, wear clothing with designs no one has ever seen in order to win people’s praise for our fashionability, or to earn a grade that no one else has (like 100%) in order to be included in a “historical figure” box in the next edition of The Squirrel’s Guide to Philosophocle.</p>
<p>We are the Uniformists. We believe it is neither necessary nor virtuous to be unique. Uniqueness leads to egotism, triviality, frivolity, artistic confusion, a belief that the world is conspiring against you, and hallucinations.</p>
<p>Instead, we celebrate our common humanity. In a world where everyone is asking you to be different, we find solace in being the same.</p>
<p>Q: How can I join?</p>
<p>A: Wear a U-shirt and join our <a href="uniformist-lunch-table.html">daily lunch table</a>!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“You should have been before the Creativists!” I told them after the opera finished. “Then I wouldn’t have wasted so much time making this shirt!”</p>
<p>Not Important and Unnamed looked at each other. “Unfortunately, the Activities and Ideologies Fair has two entrances. What’s ‘before’ to you is ‘after’ to someone else.”</p>
<p>“It would make more sense for one to be the Entrance and another to be the Exit, so everyone is moving the same direction,” I pointed out.</p>
<p>“But it wouldn’t be fair to impose Uniformity on everyone. Uniformity is a choice,” Not Important said.</p>
<p>“But the only reasonable one,” Unnamed added.</p>
<p>“Excusez moi,” Trevisia called from the adjacent table, “We’re running out of shirts. Will you give us some of yours? We’d pay for them, of course.”</p>
<p>“Absolutely not,” Unnamed said, “we can’t allow you to deface our pure shirts!”</p>
<p>Not Important cut in. “Un, Uniformists are supposed to be uniformly kind! I empathize with your lack of shirts, Trevisia, but I am afraid I cannot conscientiously sell our T-shirts if they will be decorated upon. What will students think, if they see U-shirts that have been painted with markers and plastic eyes? It will send a conflicting message about the meaning of ‘U’, and lead to fragmentation of our society.”</p>
<p>I started laughing. The scene was absurd. The Creativists still had glitter, glitter glue, metal hooks, plastic eyes, pipe cleaners, bubble-letter tracers, a Random Quote Box, beads, thread, yarn, buttons, paint, spray paint, felt, sew-on-pockets, cardboard, cotton balls, flower petals, acorn caps, last autumn’s leaves, feathers dropped from birds in flight, and coconut shells, but no shirts!</p>
<p>“It’s like making a bread with sugar and no flour. Or writing a thesis with pen but no paper!”</p>
<p>Unnamed held up a hand. “Do not use unsanctioned metaphors,” she said, “for what if they make it into the next edition of The Squirrel’s Guide to Philosophocle, and become a mark of distinction between the ingroup and outgroup?”</p>
<p>I was immediately chastised. Trevisia was still looking around frantically for shirts; her skills apparently did not involve Creating shirts out of thin air.</p>
<p>“You can have my shirt back!” I said, throwing my Creativist shirt at her.</p>
<p>“But Frokkoli—Frungular? Don’t you want to show your creative side sometime?”</p>
<p>I ignored her protests and walked smoothly out the door of the Ideologies fair. I had found what I had came for.</p>

  <div class="blog-main">
    <p><a href="/posts/how-i-became-a-creativist.html">Part I</a></p>
<p>The Randomizer was a small wooden box. My first task was to decorate it. I strung together beads of all the colors of the rainbow and gave the box a showy tail; I covered the box with blue glitter glue; I bent several paper clips to make a wire head, filled in with two eyes of fake emerald<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, and added two confetti legs. It was no longer a box but a peacock. Randomizer was such a lame name, so I named him Peapocky, and hung him around my neck.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>“That is shit-tastic,” Lisa said, and then explained the initiation. Every thirty minutes the Randomizer—ahem, Peapocky—would beep, and a piece of paper would come out of his stomach. It would have a prompt such as “sing a song and dance a jig at the same time,” or “pretend to have a split personality,” or “make architecture” or “make an ad for a student club” or “say what you’re thinking out loud, in couplet form.” She told me the rules.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>After I pressed START, I must follow every instruction from Peapocky until he ran out of slips (about one week).</p></li>
<li><p>If I did not follow every instruction, Rudii, the Creativist Initiator and a psychology major with hawk-like eyes, would be able to tell from my fleeting facial expressions (or from a network of spies—Lisa couldn’t tell which), and I would be a “frigging-fracking-fugging failure.”</p></li>
<li><p>If Peapocky beeped in a public location, I was not allowed to move to a private location.</p></li>
<li><p>I could turn Peapocky off only during class and sleep.</p></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Peapocky first beeped when I was walking to Introductory Philosophy the next morning. I picked up the slip of paper which had dropped to the gravel path.</p>
<p>“Interact with an animal only you can see,” it said.</p>
<p>But there were students around me everywhere! I closed my eyes and thought about not listening to Peopocky. But then I imagined Rudii’s spies watching me from a secret window. I imagined Lisa, at the end of the week, saying “Sorry, sissy-ninny, you shit-tastically flunked, I’ll have to take your Pee-poo-kooky-thing back.”</p>
<p>But then I remembered: I’ve always wanted to have a hedgehog as a pet. I would paint his quills rainbow (so that even though he was rolled up he would be beautiful) and name him “Heggymony”.</p>
<p>When I opened my eyes, I imagined Heggymony had gotten lost in the throng of students stampeding to class. I looked everywhere for him, asking passerby if they had seen Heggymony. I followed a trail of quills until I found him and screamed, “Don’t step on Heggymony!” and shielded him from the tens of trotting and trampling student feet. I went down on my hands and knees and scooped him up, tickling him and cooing so that he would uncurl and show his bright little face, with his two dark pools of silently observing eyes, to the world. I stroked his quills as I sat down, like an island in the middle of a stream, and said his favorite line, “Individual elements, moving at random, pose no threat to the Heggymony.”</p>
<p>Only then did I redden, expecting a crowd to have formed around me, around the girl taking to air.</p>
<p>But, to my surprise not a single student had stopped or even seemed to notice, except for the girl who had almost tripped over Heggymony and said, “Watch it!”</p>
<p>Over the next week, during the Creativist Initiation, I went through three phases.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Fear</strong>: I expected the other students to point, laugh, and say, “Trevisia, have you gone nut-so?” or “What is the meaning of that song-and-jig?” or “Trevisia, may I take you to the Center for Physical and Mental Wellbeing?” I expected the gardener to rush over and tell me to vacate my bench because I was spoiling the peaceful environs. I so dreaded Peapoudolis’s beep, and even considered burying him at the bottom of my bookbag. I didn’t do so, only because I feared even more being rejected by the Creativists.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Peace</strong>: After two days of no one telling me I had gone nut-so, my fears evaporated like dewdrops. The beeps became a law of nature. When I heard them, I didn’t panic, but slowly picked up the fallen slip of paper. My mind, rather than acting like a flock of pigeons who had just landed on a live electrical wire, reacted like a flock of pigeons conducting an aerodynamic show.</p>
<p>It was at this time that I started noticing the other to-be-Creativists carrying out their initiations. A girl recited a poem praising the clouds as she acted out a tae-kwon-do-like move. A boy’s two hands acted out characters hurling insults at each other as they battled with pencils. Another boy decorated the lamps and chairs around him with paper butterflies topped with glitter that he had stashed away in a little wooden box with wings. A girl took colored chalk from a little wooden box she wore on a bracelet and decorated the sidewalks with an advertisement for the “Underwater Breathing Society.” A person of neutral sex created an impromptu maze for an ant that had the misfortune of crawling on the desk at thirty minutes past the hour.</p>
<p>Some of their eyes were clouded by fear, and didn’t see me. Others had reached a Zen-like state. I gave them smiles to neutralize the Uniformist hostility. We shared a secret solidarity, even though we never talked, each busy with our own Creating.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Anger</strong>: How could I not have seen the other Creativists before this week? The answer dawned: Such was the power that the Uniformists and Classicists had over Philosophocle that they had blinded me to all the uniqueness in plain view! The other students weren’t ignoring us out of spite—like pre-Creativist me, they didn’t even <em>see</em> us! I wanted to shout at them, holding back only because of the no talking signs in the library.</p>
<p>And it <em>wasn’t</em> true that nobody paid us any mind. During our Creatings, Some people shot us laser-like looks of ambiguous meaning. They had U-shirts on. I wanted to scream made-up curse words at them, but checked myself, because although Lisa was truly a friend (not just a conversation partner as she claimed), I had no desire to be the same as her. I contented myself with scowling, experimenting with all the different ways I could contort my facial features.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I’m sure that when Rudii inspected me one week later, the fire in my eyes gave me away. She nodded in approval. I was finally a Creativist.</p>
<p>What is it like to become a Creativist, you ask?</p>
<p>It was as I was seeing in color for the first time. It was as if I had turned into a squirrel, and the trees on campus were no longer just trees, but towers with trellises, terraces, and turrets, their burls and whorls the faces of woodland gods.</p>

  <div class="blog-main">
    <h2 id="trivia-night">1 Trivia night</h2>
<p>“Trevisia, you must be good at trivia! Why else would you be named so?”</p>
<p>After a semester and a half of failing subjects from Classical Painting to Introduction to Debate, I was desperate to find my calling.</p>
<p>“I’m no good at exams,” I told my roommates.</p>
<p>“These aren’t like exam questions. The questions in trivia nights are <em>unusual</em>.” <!--more--></p>
<p>They wouldn’t tell me how, though. As we walked to the <a href="the-street.html">Electric Eel</a>, I imagined the trivia-masters would ask questions such as identification of unusual colors, or the eight elements named in the Faerie Sonnets, or the right ratio of baking powder to baking soda in banana bread, that I would be uniquely able to answer.</p>
<p>But the masculinity of trivia appalled me. Trivia brought out the vilest parts of people. They tried to regurgitate answers that had been memorized from encyclopedias, newspapers, PHSS, the Internet, professors, missed questions on exams, word of mouth, or the “fact sheets” posted around campus and at the bus stop (for those who forgot to bring a book to pass the time).</p>
<p>I felt as if I were among <a href="uniformist-lunch-table.html">Uniformists</a>, except worse, because they were rowdy, all raising their hands, pounding on the tables, and clinking iced cubes in their drinks. I could feel the same answer being echoed in half the minds, even though I did not know what the answer was. Every time the Great Danzini directed a question at me, I came up with a random name, such as “Jeanatta Wullis” or “Ruthner Quorcum”. Unfortunately, not a single one was right. It was as if I was standing on one of the rings of Neptune, trying to throw a dart to hit exactly the pinnacle of Philosophocle.</p>
<h2 id="a-free-friend">2 A Free Friend</h2>
<p>After trivia night I decided to cash in my “free 3am friend” coupon. The girl behind the counter looked tired and pugnacious.</p>
<p>“I have a coupon…” I said tentatively.</p>
<p>She picked up the phone on her desk and dialed.</p>
<p>“Hey Agnes, we have a befriendee here…”</p>
<p>She gave me the phone.</p>
<p>“What would you like to talk about?” came the voice from the other end.</p>
<p>I took a deep breath. “I’m having this crisis, I just went to trivia night at the Electric Eel, and if I were to compare myself to a tree, each question they asked me wounded me like a swing of an ax…”</p>
<p>“I’d love to help you,” came the voice at the other end of the line, “but I’m helping someone deal with a breakup right now. I grant that losing at trivia night is a bad experience, but wouldn’t you say it’s a bit more… trivial? Give the phone back to Lisa, she can find you someone else.”</p>
<p>Lisa dialed another number (no response), and another (already busy with a befriendee). She checked the charts, “Joe takes the 3-4am shift off to listen to the <a href="PHSS.html">radio hour</a>, Jannie and Lura are out of town this week… I hate to say this, but we don’t have any befrienders available today.” She wrung her hands. “Looks like the world is just shitting on you today, you literally came the only time that we don’t have a single person available. I’ll give you a rain check on that, you can come for a free friend anytime… Here, why don’t you listen to the radio, perhaps it will have some ‘Mellow beats’ like last week.”</p>
<p>But instead it was some kind of primal screeching accompanied by clangs of metal.</p>
<p>“You sucking dicktail!” Lisa shouted at the radio, banging it against the table. “All I ask is some calming music and you give me this piss!”</p>
<p>Usually I don’t like caustic personalities. But somehow, at this unreal time, it seemed exactly what I needed. Lisa felt like someone flailing, beautifully. Like a dancer performing on the edge of a fountain, giving the illusion of falling but never actually falling. Like me, except that I would actually fall in.</p>
<p>“What about you?” I asked hesitantly, “Can’t you be my 3am friend?”</p>
<p>“Absolutely not! I’m the receptionist only. Though I don’t know why the freaking leaking hellspont I signed up for the job. Actually I do—it’s related to a social experiement—oh never mind. I’m not accredited, last time I tried it I made the befriendee cry.”<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>She sipped a cup of fragrant black liquid.</p>
<p>“What is that?”</p>
<p>“This? Coffee. You’ve never had coffee before? Oh, you’re missing out, girl. Here, why don’t you have a cup. We can’t be friends, but we can be conversation partners. Is that good enough for you?”</p>
<p>Over the strangly energizing liquid I poured out all my troubles to Lisa. It turned out that the trivia night was just the tip of the iceberg that my ship had run into. Everywhere in Philosophocle I saw the unbending necessity to memorize equations, or “recall the classics”. Professor Klausicus told us that “we never make anything new, all we do is regurgitate the olds. Therefore, I will teach you to regurgitate the best of the olds.” When I told him that I made new names every day for fun, was that not “new”? he gave me a stern look and a tap on the knuckles, “Besides the mountains of literature, that does not even amount to a sand speck.” When I signed up for painting class, I imagined myself drawing winged horses, castles built from coral reefs, or aurora boreali, but the teacher instead everyone drew the same apple, and was graded on realism!</p>
<p>When I wandered around campus for three hours in a daze after “trivia night”, it was not because of the stress of answering trivia questions under pressure nor the “iced tea”, but rather the combined pressure of my Philosophocle education thus far.</p>
<p>Lisa looked at me grimly.</p>
<p>“It seems like you need to meet the Creativists.”</p>
<p>She stood up.</p>
<p>“I’m closing tonight, as all our ‘friends’ are busy or slacking. Let’s go take a walk.”</p>
<h2 id="the-religions-of-philosophocle">3 The Religions of Philosophocle</h2>
<p>I told Lisa how my dormmates were Uniformists who kept pressuring me to join. They had donated all their old clothes to charity and replaced them with a wardrobe of U-shirts. How I shudder to think of a wardrobe being replaced like that! Imagine my rainbow colored shirts—one for each day of the week—all replaced by a uniform gray! As my three roommates descended deeper into Uniformism, I could no longer tell them apart. They would all eat breakfast together—identical slices of toast and cups of milk, everything—and I’d be along in my room, eating my box of Fruity Puffs. They’d all be smiling when they saw me, offering to lend me one of their U-shirts.</p>
<p>Not to mention, when we arrived at trivia night, they joined their Uniformist friends.</p>
<p>“Come join us,” they had said, but I refused, and was team-less.</p>
<p>“What a backhanded ploy to get you to joint the Uniformists!” Lisa said, “I’m glad you didn’t give in. But how could you miss the Creativists? Weren’t you at the Ideologies Fair at the beginning of the year?”</p>
<p>“Yes. It was so threatening, though! When I went in, the Theoreticians and the Applications were screaming at each other, and both of their presidents appealed to me to pick a side. I just backed out the door. As I was leaving, though, someone came up to me and gave me a coupon for a free friend.”</p>
<p>I noticed some ghostly figures drifting across campus. The two leaders had blankets draped over their shoulders.</p>
<p>“Who are they?” I asked.</p>
<p>“The Wonderers. You really missed everything at the Ideologies Fair, didn’t you? It’s alright, I’ll give you an overview.” She pointed at the stars. “What does that look like to you?”</p>
<p>I squinted. I tried to make out a deer, a wok, a stairway to heaven, a snake eating its own tail, anything, but came up with “a glob?”</p>
<p>“Exactly. So that’s the Uniformists, there.” She pointed at various constellations as she rattled off the groups. “Then you have their arch-enemies, the Creativists, see how that’s a person singing, dancing, and waving a paintbrush at the same time? That dark patch—there’s the Self-Effacers, you won’t see them much. Then there are the Techies and the Naturies, the Society for Family Values, the Sexists<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>, and the Poly House, the Vegetarian Co-op and the Omnivorous Co-op, the Existentialists, Nonexistentialists, Rationalists, Utilitarians, Relativizers, Altruists, Egoists, Feel-Gooders, Faithers, Experimentalists, Unknowers, Choosers, Stoners<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>, Freewillers, Determiners, Probabilists…”</p>
<p>We ducked under an archway of two kissing trees and came to a humble blue doorway. Lisa fiddled with the lock and the door opened. She struck a match and lit a lantern hanging beside the door.</p>
<p>“This is <a href="the-scoop.html">the Scoop</a>. There aren’t any cookies here now, though there is some delicious cookie dough in the fridge. But the real exhibit is downstairs.”</p>
<p>Just looking at the cafe for a few seconds under the dim light, I could tell it was a friendly place. The walls were chalkboards upon which students had wrote poems that I did not recognize as part of the “classics”. Unlike the identical, industrial stools of the Electric Eel, the chairs were all flawed in their own way, like individual people.</p>
<p>After Lisa fed me some cookie dough, we went to the Workshop in the basement.</p>
<p>There were three long tables, filled with art supplies like glitter, glitter glue, scissors, metal hooks, plastic eyes, pipe cleaners, bubble-letter tracers, a Random Quote Box, beads, thread, yarn, buttons, colored pencils, paint, spray paint, construction paper, felt, cardboard, burnt-out light bulbs, cut-out book covers, magazines, shells, stones, clay, sketch books, craft books, pop-up books, T-shirts awaiting color, used-up toilet paper rolls, starcharts, toothpicks, cotton balls, socks, flower petals, acorn caps, last autumn’s leaves, feathers dropped from birds in flight, and coconut shells. The floor was covered with old newspaper. There was a U-shirt hanging from a clothesline, which had been defaced by the addition of a set of arms and legs to the U. (I saw then, crystal clear, what U meant: it was an empty receptacle, waiting to be filled, incapable of filling itself.) There was a half-decayed mushroom palace, made from the fruits of a mycological expedition.</p>
<p>The whole place smelled like alphabet soup. I smiled as I remembered long dinners of focused rearrangement, trying to find the most mellifluous combinations of phonemes despite a lack of vowels.</p>
<p>“Wow. Can I use this space?”</p>
<p>“You can if you are a Creativist. But you must complete the initiation before you can become a Creativist. Will you accept the challenge?”</p>
<p>I nodded. I didn’t trust myself to open my mouth to speak—if I did, I was sure that I would spew out a series of never-before spoken words. The language I knew seemed inadequate to express what I felt.</p>
<p>Lisa opened a drawer and took out a small wooden box with a handle. “This,” she said, “is a Randomizer.”</p>

  <div class="blog-main">
    <p>Now that the weather is warmer, many students run along the River of Knowledge. One advantage of running as opposed to walking is the ability to see many Philosophocler students in a shorter period of time, or be seen by many Philosophocler students.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The Creativists take this opportunity to show off their hand-painted T-shirts (featuring a never-before seen hue of pink or blue), or the silken wings they have painstakingly woven, or their antlered hat lined with melodic bells. (They run slightly slower, however, with their gear.)</p>
<p>Not to be outdone, an equal number of Uniformists run along the river. Unlike the Creativists, they run in large groups. Actually, their exercise can’t be called “running” so much as “marching”, because they adjust their speed to that of the slowest member.</p>
<p>Regular runners check the Uniformist bulletin board in order to avoid the times that the Uniformists run, but sometimes the Uniformists converge impromptu on the gravel track, like telepathic bees. For they fill up the path, almost shoulder to shoulder, and are impossible to pass without either detouring into the woods and facing its brambles and vines, or even less attractively, detouring into the river and facing angry geese.</p>
<p>I find it pleasant to meet Creativists running the other way, as they will often wave to me using a hand gesture they made up on the spot, and which I will mull over for the rest of the day (did the upwards wiggle mean “find your wings, no matter how unsteady your first flight will be?” or did they mean “eventually we will ascend to the heavens and leave this world, no matter how firmly we try to hold on to the ground?” or did they mean “beware the smoke that your campfire leaves, lest you make yourself known to the enemy”? The Creativists will do well to ponder on this last interpretation.).</p>

    <p>The other Uniformists waited for me as I left the lecture hall. Each Uniformist had kept track of the number of other Uniformists in their section of the lecture hall. (We were all easy to identify thanks to our identical shirts.) I had noted seven other Unis in the middle section and so had every other Uni in the middle section, so we would not leave until all seven Unis from the middle section had gathered. This ritual of waiting gives me a sense of belonging.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>We walked past the students holding up signs, each trying to advertise their skill at conversation, friendliness, or even flirtatiousness.</p>
<p>“Looking for someone to sit by at lunch. I will provide conversation. Can talk about classical literature (Greek, Roman, Chinese), plant identification, secret places on campus, and the history of the university library,” or “Will flirt during lunch. Warning: expect no commitment after lunch is over,” or “Practice improvisational poetry over food at the Rhyme &amp; Thyme. Poetry experience required. Give me a line before you come!”</p>
<p>One of the Unis tried to pass them brochures on Uniformism, but was politely rejected. We do this not for our sake, of course, but for theirs. The “lunch hookers,” as are sometimes called, suffer from too much egotism, and too little faith in community. Their longing for a fresh conversation partner every day, I can only imagine, induces a profound sense of loneliness.</p>
<p>At lunch, we choose our entrees, but get the same side of carrot wedges. (Before we had tried to all get the same entrees, but this often meant that we depleted the entire pot and had to wait for the cooks to come out with another, and could not all eat at the same time; not to mention, various dietary restrictions made this difficult; if not communicated correctly this often caused one person to have a different entree and hence stand out, the very thing we were trying to avoid.)</p>
<p>The three round tables are there, waiting for us. The rest of the school has learned to keep them aside for us. Sometimes there is a lone student sitting there, one who does not know yet of the Uniformists. If ey is truly ignorant of the Uniformists, we will toss em a free shirt before bidding em be on eir way.</p>
<p>Our group is too large for one conversation, so we converse with the people around us. We miss nothing: if you walk down our tables, you will only hear variations of the same conversation.</p>
<p>“How has your morning been?” we ask each other.</p>
<p>“Fair. I woke up tired, had a cup of hot tea, and felt daunted by the prospect of one-and-a-half-hour of Feller’s Social Ethics. The weather seemed to reflect my semi-anticipatory mood. The lecture both met and did not meet my expectations. As always, lunch is a joy.”</p>
<p>Hearing each other’s daily morning routines, we are relieved that we are not alone in those first depressive moments of waiting for tea to boil in the cold morning. We remember that many of the other Unis are carrying out the same task. We take pride in the our seldom-broken morning habits. Any among us that have failed the morning routine - for example, woken up a minute before lecture and almost forgotten to change pajamas to unis before running across campus - will be motivated to return to their routine the next day.</p>
<p>“How are the carrots?”</p>
<p>“They are soft and overcooked. They are not the freshest carrots. However, they have been cut well.”</p>
<p>Nods spread around the table.</p>
<p>We mention many more constancies.</p>
<p>“How is the homework?”</p>
<p>“It is difficult at first glance. As I struggled with it, it became easier and I understood the material better.”</p>
<p>Nods; this was as it should be.</p>
<p>“How did you sleep last night?”</p>
<p>“I remember nothing of it.”</p>
<p>Nods; this was as it should be.</p>
<p>“What was the average grade on the exam?”</p>
<p>“It is an improvement over the first exam.”</p>
<p>Nods; for what mattered were not our individual grades, but the performance of the class as a whole.</p>
<p>Sometimes one of the new members will open eir pamphlets to glance at the standard questions. They soon learn, however, that there is little need: all ey needed was to not think too hard before asking the questions.</p>
<p>When we finish we line up to put our trays on the washing carousel. We say our goodbyes as we disperse to afternoon classes.</p>

    <p>The Scoop is $25/year, and it offers all the cookies you can have. Mounds and mounds of them, baked by energetic graduates (or current students) trying to make a living—working on their novels or paintings or whatnot in the daytime, baking cookies in a semi-somnolent state in the evenings. They seem especially prone to laughter.</p>

<p>It’s been my favorite haunt for fifty years. Of course, as a freshman they took us to every tea shop to get a sample, until we were so full with caffeine that we wouldn’t dream of sleeping until the next night, and so full of liquid that there were lines for the bathrooms everywhere we went. Groups of freshmen sang in merriment as they caroused down the sidewalk, sweeping paper cups of tea samples off the platters held by smartly dressed waiters. I remember those days fondly.</p>
<p>Trevisia, with her thick braids that look like bread twists that are colored red, green, and yellow, is at the counter today, ready to assist anyone who is struggling with the hot water machine (and ready to administer first aid if they accidentally pour boiling water on themselves), coming up with creative names for each batch of cookies (such as “Flourclouds” or “Fantasmittles”), and making sure that no one takes more than their fair share of cookies. (What constitutes a “fair share” is subject to debate. Certainly, anyone who takes five cookies and leaves will be subject to “cold tea” in the future.)<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>The Scoop Bakers are the people who know the most students by name.<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> After all, almost every student comes by the Scoop (except those who have gluten allergies, people on low-sugar diets (including Stoics), and those in the Poly House, who prefer to bake their own cookies), and it is difficult not to get drawn into the Scoop Bakers’ monologues-turned-dialogues (are we ourselves cookies being baked by the oven that is Philosophocle? when will we be ready? will there will be little time to bask in our fullness before we are eaten? what do you think, oh cookie-taker?). Plus, if you know the Bakers well enough, they may even surprise you with a birthday cookie on your birthday and sing to you. (Wisely, they do not do the same to me; I do not like to be reminded of my birthdays. Furthermore, the calendar is an <a href="leap-day.html">artificial construct</a>.)</p>
<p>Do note that coming to the Scoop means consenting to be people-watched by the Bakers, who look over the counter at the amassed tables of students (and lonely professors like me who need a little evening brightness, or sugar, in their lives) like benign life-giving gods and goddesses.<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The students munch cookies while conversing in the hushed tones of confidants; or screaming out their new “slam poems”; or screwing up their brows in concentration as they practice their deconstruction skills on towers made of wooden blocks; or drawing on the wall-to-wall blackboards with colored chalk in either hand, trying their best to be ambidextrous artists. Or they stare at space (or perhaps Trevisia’s rainbow braids) as they wait for inspiration, a pen poised frozen in their hands, a cookie cooling in front of them, to be resisted until they have written the next sentence in their thesis.</p>
<p>Everything here has a unique character. Take the chairs for example. There is the throne sofa (first-come, first-serve) and its foil, the “baby stool” that short people like to make their tall friends sit on, the one four-legged chairs that wobbles, the foldable chair that will fold when you try to sit on it, a chair made of cardboard (donated by an engineering student who has graduated).<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The hot water machine also has character: sometimes the water fails to stop when you turn off the spigot.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>Lisa worked as a baker for the Scoop for one day before she was fired. She cursed out a student for taking two cookies when there was one more person in line. The Bakers prefer to take a <em>passive</em>-agressive stance towards cookie gluttons, because other patrons are unforgiving enough towards anyone who makes them wait thirty minutes for the next batch of cookies.<a href="#fnref1">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>Except for Trevisia. A student of mine reported meeting Trevisia five times under different names, before she caught on. The sixth time, she remembered his name as being a combination of the five names he had given her. Memory works in odd ways.<a href="#fnref2">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>More than once, conversations in The Scoop have made their ways into novels by former Scoop-bakers-turned-writers. Chances are increased if you are a regular patron—all the more reason to come frequently.<a href="#fnref3">↩</a></p></li>

<p>Subject: <a href="/posts/these-bachelor-monks.html">Lisa</a></p>
<p>Topic: Lisa’s conversation with Fron</p>
<p>Venue: <a href="/posts/the-street.html">The Electric Eel</a></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>LISA: Standard introduction: Fron attempts to summarize himself. His favorite theorem is the Law of Large Numbers. It resonates with his philosophy, which is that over a period of many years, a moral person will with high probability, be happier, than an immoral person, and it is also very useful in Data Science. His spirit animal is a sea turtle. He used to be an overachiever—for example, writing six pages for a five-page book report—until he joined the Uniformists. He despises frivolousness, such as the <a href="/posts/snowmelt.html">“ornaments” that were placed on the Uniformed Snowmen</a>. <!--more--></p>
<p>I drop my spoon into my Dragon’s Breath Noodle Soup, sit up, and make my mind to curse him out—of course you’ve guessed that I did much of the decorating—but he continues on obliviously.</p>
<p>“But most importantly, my favorite episode during the unnamed radio hour is the one on the luminescent sea creatures, such as jellyfish.” He sees me staring at him, and asks, “Do you know about it?”</p>
<p>It happened that I’d listened to that very episode. At that moment I have a very good idea.</p>
<p>“<em>Know</em> about it?” I say, “I was the <em>host</em>. I didn’t know anyone even <em>listened</em> at that hour.”</p>
<p>“You,” he exclaims, “You’re the jellyfish girl.”</p>
<p>“I feel it presumptive to nickname me based on the contents of my radio show,” I berate him.</p>
<p>He duly apologizes.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>ME: It wasn’t you.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>LISA: Of course not! If I’d been passionate about oceanology, I would have told you long ago. It was Pearl. But he didn’t know, of course.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>ME: Then what does he say?</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>LISA: He puts down his corn-on-the-cob. He puts his hands around his kale-strawberry smoothie, looks at me very seriously (like a professor, or perhaps a stray dog) and says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Lisa, I believe we have a serious connection. I cannot overstate the symbolic significance of that episode in my life. On its surface it seems no more than a slice of esoterica, no different from the thousands of pieces of knowledge that we absorb every day, but at its core, it is the essence of beauty. Many have strayed from the path of truth because they seek it not for its radiant light, but for their own dark, ulterior motives. From your voice, however, I instantly knew that you were not one of them. You were speaking of a subject that you found beautiful in itself. I could imagine that your eyes were looking not in front of you, but instead at the luminescent jellyfish inside your own head. That to me is the essence of Philosophocle.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He waits for an answer.</p>
<p>“But I <em>had</em> an ulterior motive,” I tell him. “They wouldn’t allow me to broadcast the radio program I wanted to unless I ‘practiced’ in the unnamed radio hour first. They didn’t even allow me to say what I wanted, they put this random book in my hand and told me to recite it in the most sibilant voice I could manage. And afterwards they told me that sorry, their lineup was full, and that they would give me 10 dollars in dining credit to make up for their reneged promise! I have regretted that foray into radio ever since.”</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>ME: (laughs, clinking ice cubes in my “iced tea.”)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>LISA: He’s dumbfounded. He accuses me of lying, claims I wasn’t the girl on the radio. So I give him a rendition. Just a few sentences. It’s not even accurate, but he falls for it. Then he tries to convince me that I’d do well to adopt the character that I represented in that hour of my life.</p>
<p>I tell him that his obsession is illogical, borders on sexual fantasy, and is making me uncomfortable.</p>
<p>He looks into his soup and tells me,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“One person’s running water is another’s poetry.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He’s so earnest about it that it almost makes me feel bad. But as I’m considering telling him the truth, he abruptly stands up.</p>
<p>“Usually I don’t leave in the middle of a meal unfinished,” he says, “But this time I must. I hope thereafter, you will remember your radio hour with the same degree of dissatisfaction of termination as that which I am feeling now, in cutting my perfectly good meal short. If you ever change your mind, let me know. It’ll put my heart at rest.”</p>
<p>Then he throws his half-eaten corn-on-the-cob and pours his half-drunk rest kale-strawberry smoothie in the compost bin! He swings by the table again, and leaves. What do you make of that?</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>ME: Don’t worry, Lisa, you did the Right Thing. That was perfectly executed. This school is a zoo of mental deficiencies. Students lacking recreational activities—hell, there isn’t even <a href="these-bachelor-monks-ii.html">proper <em>coffee</em></a>—tend to fixate on random events in their life as if they were magic portals that would rescue them from the meaninglessness that they deny experiencing, and the more bluntly we can make them realize this by shattering their objects of obsession, the better.</p>
<p><em>Hell!</em> I can’t stop talking like them, ugh!</p>
<p>(I slide an ice cube in my mouth to wash away that long sentence, and down the remaining iced tea.)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>(At this point, we are both surprised as a man in a dark suit comes up to our table. He takes off his hat. His forehead is bright with sweat. His eyes sparkle like miniature disco balls. Behind him on the dance stage, customers fumble, unsure about their moves now that their instructor is gone. Because he is none other than…)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>THE GREAT DANZINI: Ladies, I can’t help but overhear. I wonder whether you can diagnose my own deficiencies.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>LISA: (Amused) And what may those be?</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>THE GREAT DANZINI: There appears to be a lack of women in my life.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>LISA: Another actor, eh? Well, buy me some more iced tea and then we’re talking.</p>

    <p><a href="/posts/these-bachelor-monks.html">&lt; Part I</a></p>
<p>There’s no lack of coffeehouses on the Street (although they call themselves teahouses, and the coffee menu is always second. Sure, to have one person prefer tea over coffee was reasonable, but a whole society? The professors and students, I concluded, must not like being jolted out of their book-induced stupor, because then they might be encouraged to try other things as well). <!--more--> It doesn’t seem, however, that these people have much of a notion of privacy - hardly I’d sit down and someone would slide in the seat across from me, introduce themselves (and their thesis topic!), and ask about me or about “the weather.” The teahouses branded themselves on being places to meet interesting strangers, and boy, was I an interesting stranger (no wonder they double-stamp my loyalty cards! I probably increased their business). I answered their questions with extensive responses that would make even the loquacious among them flinch. (The weather is shitting today. One cannot go outside without millions of liquid globules worming their way into one’s clothes. It brings to mind the inelegance of existence: are we not all bags of meat and excrement? Could the clouds not ‘use the toilet’ somewhere else, to use a euphemic term? But one aspect of cloud-shitting and human-shitting is quite different, in the degree of passion in which the heavens shit down upon us: might this be to suggest a degree of passion which is missing among the inhabitants of this world?)</p>
<p>There’s quite a few students who keep wanting to “talk to me,” “be my friend,” and so forth. I know what they want, but they won’t say it out loud, and I’m not sure that they could even say it to themselves if their lives depended on it! I, of course, will never initiate action, because that would quite ruin my follow-up, “observational” study on the sexual suppression of Philosophocle students. Instead they say that they’ve learned a new outlook on their search for knowledge by the unrivaled, symbolic contrariness of my actions, a fundamentally different and unique way of being… and then they pause as if expecting me to say something more than just “Good for you!” To use a vulgarity from the outside world, most of them never get to “first base.” (If they had sports teams, maybe they would release some of their pent-up energy…)</p>
<p>I much rather prefer Deepsea Teas. One can get a table alone there, and even draw up the curtains. I like the booths by the fish tanks. The fish stare at me and look as if they’re mouthing silent speeches at me (“Do most of our words not fall deaf on the ears of the world?” was a favorite question of Dr. “Fishface” Adams; if you attempted to reply to his question, your answer would indeed fall deaf on the ears of Dr. “Fishface” Adams). Their coffee is expensive, but if you buy their mug you get unlimited refills each visit. I heartily approve.</p>

  <div class="blog-main">
    <p>Before the snowmelt, we gathered the snowmen and snowwomen onto trolleys that snaked through the gently sloping paths of Philosophocle. <!--more--> We started from the highest point - the observatory and meteorological station (where the blackboard recorded gradually rising temperatures over the next week) - and then onwards past the library, the Pinnacle of Philosophy, the mathematics building, and the rest of the departments, detouring to drive through Philosophocle’s many gardens. The gym, dining halls, and residential halls came last.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>The snowpeople builders waited patiently. They had no desire to be like John from last year, who, eschewing trolleys, had tripped when he tried to carry his snowwoman himself. His snowwoman immediately had broken into three and each part had rolled down the hill separately.</p>
<p>When the trolley came, the snowpeople builders hoisted their buildees onto the chilled planks. Sometimes the snowpeople’s bottoms were stuck to the snow, and had to be gingerly shoveled out. Ten people assisted with pulling and pushing each trolley. Perhaps this was more than necessary, but it made sure that the trolley did not accelerate too fast.</p>
<p>Many a snowperson had been abandoned by its builder. We moved them ourselves. Some of them had already sickened, their formerly round heads and bodies turned concave. Rhina patted new snow onto them and reaffixed their appendages in the right locations. Tom, who had a supply of branches, pine cones, acorns, raisins, carrots, celery, plum tomatoes, chocolates, and spring onions handy, provided snowpeople with missing body parts.</p>
<p>It is quite rude of the creators to not furnish their createes with mouths or arms. It is also rude of the creators to not furnish their createes with names. Fortunately, Trevisia, a Creativist, can spontaneously generate names that have never been used, like Windorrilyna and Asnozzonoso. She is not very good at remembering them, but fortunately we have Albern, who jotted them down diligently onto the roster.</p>
<p>Trevisia was horrified by the row of Uniformed Snowmen in front of Campus Police. The Uniformists made them, of course. Thirty Uniformists, in their identical U sweaters, in groups of three, made ten snowmen. They constructed the snowmen to specifications: bottom ball 40 centimeters, middle ball 35 centimeters, top ball 30 centimeters. They all wore identical berets and saluted with branches bent at identical angles. Their belts contained holsters, each with three standard-issue 8-centimeter snowballs. The ten snowmen would occupy a trolley by themselves; they won’t associate with the rabble. Each snowman was carried by three Uniformists. They aren’t necessarily the same Uniformists who made them, because of course, Uniformists are interchangeable, as are Uniformed Snowmen.</p>
<p>“Names?” Trevisia asked.</p>
<p>“The Uniformed,” said Un, the leader of the Uniformists.</p>
<p>“I mean, their <em>individual names</em>,” Trevisia said, dangerously.</p>
<p>“Where one goes, all go,” Un said, as his Uniformists took up their places around the trolley. “No individuality is required.”</p>
<p>“Snowpeople without names are not allowed in the Shades.”</p>
<p>“Trevisia!” I hissed. “Drop it!”</p>
<p>The Uniformists looked restless. With so many vulnerable snowmen around, we did not want to risk a fight.</p>
<p>Trevisia took off her rainbow scarf and rushed towards the Uniformed trolley. Un moved to stop her but she threw and the scarf landed around one of the uniformed snowman, distinguishing him from the other nine. It was a grave insult. One of the Unis yanked it off. The other Unis reached for their snowmen’s ammunition. They aimed at Trevisia. In panic, Trevisia jumped onto our trolley, and it started moving forward. The Unis fired. Several hit Trevisia on her back, while several others missed and hit a snowman on our cart, toppling its head.</p>
<p>“Stop!” Un yelled. “This is not the Uniformist way!” Tom and Albern from our group picked up snow to retaliate.</p>
<p>“The cart!” I yelled.</p>
<p>It was veering away from the path, downhill. We ran to catch it. It took all of us to stop the cart. Another head toppled from the sudden deceleration.</p>
<p>Trevisia was in tears. She didn’t speak, just violently brushed snow off her coat. One of the Uniformists dangled her scarf in front of her.</p>
<p>“We are sorry, madam. It won’t happen again.”</p>
<p>Trevisia snatched her scarf back and dries her eyes with it. The twenty-nine other Unis come too.</p>
<p>“How may we assist in rebuilding your snowmen?”</p>
<p>“They’re not snow<em>men</em>! They’re snowmen-and-<em>women</em>! Like this one you killed!” She pointed at a head grinning at the sky. “Don’t put your dirty hands on our snowpeople!”</p>
<p>The Uniformists looked at Un, unsure.</p>
<p>“Let’s go, Unis.”</p>
<p>They took up positions at their cart and wheeled it away.</p>
<hr>
<p>Rhina and Tom repaired our snowpeople, and we made it the rest of the way to the Shades without incident. Last year, we had been ambushed in front of Peterhall by students throwing snowballs from the roof. One of them had hit the snow-giraffe, whose neck had taken Rhina a whole hour to make. We identified the culprit, and demanded that he explain himself.</p>
<p>“Impermanence,” he had said. “We wanted to show that the effort of preserving snowpeople is futile. Snowpeople melt, whether they are alone or together.”<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> We forced him to sit outside for an entire day in the Shades watching the snowmen melt, in order to appreciate impermanence. The penance had a profound effect on him, and he became very quiet after that, with a furtive look as if haunted by ghosts, the same kind of look people got a few months after joining the Poly House.</p>
<p>When we arrived at the Shades, the Uniformed Snowmen had already taken their positions in a semicircle in front of the courtyard. We set up the rest of the snowpeople inside the courtyard. As more snowpeople came in, we arranged them in groups facing each other, like conversational groups at <a href="the-street.html">Melli’s Flows</a>. We gave them bottles of Iced Tea that Lisa had collected from the Electric Eel (she’s somewhat of an addict). The only ones who didn’t join in the merry party atmosphere were the Uniformed, looking out at the sun.</p>
<p>Why do we do this? Ten years ago, the students had found their snowpeople disappearing from where they were built. They appeared at the Shades: a courtyard that always in shadow from the slanted winter sun. For four years this migration was continued by a mysterious altruist who was never discovered. After that, the student graduated (presumably), but the rest of the student body has carried on the tradition. Each year before the weather warms, we carry the snowmen to the Shades, where they melt together, rather than alone. During this period, at any time during the day, it is likely that at least one student will be watching the snowpeople’s silent soiree. It seems to be a metaphor to life: even if we put on a veneer of merrymaking like the snowpeople do, we are all slowly melting. Or the converse: since we are all slowly melting, we might as well merrymake together.</p>
<hr>
<p>Early the next morning, strolling past the Shades, I found that the Uniformed Snowmen had all been distinguished! One had a pine-cone badge, another had a garland of leaves, another had acorn buttons, and yet another had dried cranberry nipples! Anxiety gripped my throat: I had to remove them before the Uniformed saw them - surely they would take revenge on Trevisia for defacing their watchmen! I hurried over after looking furtively around to see that no one else was there, and then started to remove the ornaments. Perhaps if one of the Uniformed arrived, they would mistakenly think I was the culprit, but it was be a chance that I had to take.</p>
<p>“In the name of Santa-fucking-Claus, stop!” someone shouted. I turned around to see Lisa running up. “This is shit-tastic, what the dammit are you doing! Oh bitches, I think I screwed up word usage again,” she made a face. “Why are you thieving the watchmen?”</p>
<p>I explained what had happened.</p>
<p>“Don’t you worry, homey-boy, the Uniformists will have to go through me before they get to Trev! Now be a good elf and put those back, won’t you?”</p>
<p>I was relieved to be relieved of my vigilantist responsibility. Lisa walked around the Uniformed Snowmen furrowing her brows critically as if they were sculptures at an art museum, while I skittered off.</p>
<p>I didn’t come by the Shades until the evening. Remarkably enough, the baubles stayed where they were, although the nippled snowman gained a few more… indecencies. Lisa had worked her magic. Still, over the next week, I noticed that Trevisia darted past the Shades without looking at the snowmen, as if afraid of being caught looking.</p>

<p>Already the snowpeople have crooked smiles and missing eyes. The squirrels and birds feast on them.<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>But perhaps the Uniformists will have the last laugh. Despite all our fancy decorations, the snowmen will soon start to become indistinguishable in their misery (we are all alike in death). The Uniformed will be first to go, their position being most vulnerable to the sun. The rest will soon follow.</p>
